# amuleapi 27-static-frontend — static-frontend fallthrough.
#
# Asserts that GET / HEAD requests outside `/api/` are served from the
# directory pointed to by `[Server]/StaticRoot` when set; that the
# realpath-based symlink containment rejects escapes; that the 16 MiB
# size cap fires; that conditional GET via `If-None-Match` short-
# circuits to 304; and that the SPA fallback to `index.html` only
# kicks in for extension-less misses (not for missing assets).
#
# Requires `[Server]/StaticRoot` set to a writable directory containing
# an `index.html` (the script plants symlinks + a 17 MiB sentinel there
# during the run). `run-all.sh` provisions /tmp/amuleapi-27-static-frontend-static
# automatically; manual runs need to edit the conf themselves.
# Note: discovery of the install-path default (`AMULEAPI_STATIC_DIR`,
# bundle Resources, wxStandardPaths) is covered by StaticFsTest at the
# unit level; this script covers the static-serve wire mechanics.
#
# Usage:
#   amuleapi --config-dir=/tmp/amuleapi-regtest &
#   ./27-static-frontend.sh
#
# Exits 0 on success, 1 on any failed assertion, 2 on bring-up error.
