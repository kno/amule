# amuleapi 21-sse-heartbeat — Server-Sent Events: streaming infrastructure +
# heartbeat-only /events endpoint.
#
# Wire contract for Phase 8a:
#   * GET /api/v0/events → 200 with Content-Type: text/event-stream
#     and Transfer-Encoding: chunked. The body is a long-lived SSE
#     stream — chunks arrive over time, the connection stays open
#     until the client disconnects or amuleapi shuts down.
#   * Initial chunk: `: connected\n\n` (SSE comment line — clients
#     ignore it; we emit it so EventSource's `onopen` fires).
#   * Heartbeat: `: keepalive\n\n` every 15 s. Comment-line shape so
#     it doesn't pollute the client's event handlers.
#   * Auth: same bearer/cookie gate as the rest of the API. No
#     credentials → 401 with the standard JSON error body. (No 403
#     for guest tokens — SSE is a read-only push, guest-friendly.)
#
# Phase 8b layers event generation (download_added / _updated /
# _removed / status / etc.); 8c adds Last-Event-ID replay; 8d adds
# resync + log events.
