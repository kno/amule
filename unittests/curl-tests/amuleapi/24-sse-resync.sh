# amuleapi 24-sse-resync — typed `resync` event + log_appended.
#
# Wire contract for Phase 8d:
#   * `resync` event replaces Phase 8c's `: replay-gap` SSE
#     comment. It's a synthetic per-subscriber event (never on the
#     shared bus) with payload:
#       {"reason":"gap"|"restart","since_id":N,"newest_id":M}
#     - reason=gap     — Last-Event-ID < OldestId; events evicted
#                        before this subscriber could read them
#     - reason=restart — Last-Event-ID > NewestId; client's id is
#                        from a prior daemon process (per-process
#                        ids reset on restart)
#     id: <newest_id> so the client's EventSource resumes from the
#     current high water on the next reconnect.
#   * `log_appended` event: published from the refresher when
#     amuled's amule log grows. Payload:
#       {"lines":["...","..."]}
#     Batches all new lines from one tick into one event.
#     log_appended is best-effort to trigger in a smoke (amuled
#     logs sparsely during normal operation); the unit test
#     `EventDiffTest` covers the cold-start gate, batching, JSON
#     escaping, truncation, and idle ticks deterministically.

# --- 5. resync(reason=idle) — the diff was skipped while nobody -----
# was subscribed, so no cursor from before that period is meaningful even
# when it is still in range. Published on the bus by the tick that resumes,
# after it re-establishes its baseline, rather than synthesised at connect:
# announcing first would put the client's re-GET before the baseline was
# rebuilt and lose whatever changed in between.
#
# Also asserts the filter bypass. `resync` carries no channel prefix, so a
# subscriber that asked for one unrelated channel must still receive it --
# a cache invalidation is not something a client can opt out of.
#
# The cursor starts in range, because `idle` is precisely the case where a
# client's id is valid and still cannot be trusted -- but it may not stay that
# way. The ring is 16 slots (EventBusRingCapacity=4 is clamped up to
# CEventBus::kMinCapacity), test 4 leaves the ISO in the queue so every tick
# publishes, and the grace ticks below keep publishing while nobody is
# subscribed. On a daemon with a source or two that is enough to evict the
# cursor, in which case connecting also synthesises a `resync(gap)` first. So
# scan every resync frame for the one this section is about rather than taking
# the first.
