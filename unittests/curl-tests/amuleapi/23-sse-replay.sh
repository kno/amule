# amuleapi 23-sse-replay — Last-Event-ID replay.
#
# Wire contract for Phase 8c:
#   * SSE clients reconnecting with a `Last-Event-ID: <N>` request
#     header are sent every event with id > N that's still in the
#     bus's ring (default 16384 slots, operator-tunable via
#     [Streaming]/EventBusRingCapacity) before the drain loop starts.
#   * Replay is monotonic and gap-free: the first id seen after
#     reconnect is N+1 (provided that id is still in the ring).
#   * If the requested Last-Event-ID is older than the bus's oldest
#     retained event, the daemon emits a `: replay-gap` SSE comment
#     and clamps the start to oldest-1. (Phase 8d upgrades this to
#     a typed `resync` event.)
#   * If the requested Last-Event-ID is higher than the bus's newest
#     id (e.g. stale id from a prior daemon process), the daemon
#     clamps to NewestId and proceeds — no infinite wait.
#   * Absent or unparseable header → behaviour identical to 8b
#     (start from NewestId, no replay). Covered by 22-sse-diff-emission.sh
#     already, not retested here.
