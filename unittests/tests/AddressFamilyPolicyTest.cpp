// Which address families aMule opens sockets in.
//
// Two properties are worth pinning for reasons that outlast this PR:
//
//   1. The default is IPv4-only. Piece 4 of the widening is gated so nothing advertises IPv6 until
// a switch is deliberately turned on. A default of DualStack would hand the first caller dual stack
// with no switch thrown, leaving the gate in place but guarding nothing.
//   2. Refusal never falls back. Opening a v4 socket towards a v6 target is how a truncated address
// becomes a connection to the wrong host, so a target the configuration forbids yields no protocol
// at all.
//
// The configured family is process-global mutable state, so every case below restores what it
// found. The default is captured at static-initialisation time rather than read inside a test,
// which keeps the first assertion independent of the order the cases run in.
