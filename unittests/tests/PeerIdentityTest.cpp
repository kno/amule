// Peer identity: what identifies a peer once a peer can be IPv6.
//
// Before this change a peer was a 32-bit address, so an inbound IPv6 peer was
// accepted by the socket and then dropped -- there was nothing to index it
// under. Widening that identity has three failure modes worth pinning, and only
// one of them is about IPv6:
//
//   1. Merging two peers that are not the same peer. The exact bug this guards
//      against already happened once in this tree: the banned-client list
//      accepted an absent address, banned it as the key 0.0.0.0, and every
//      client with an unknown address then read back as banned. Any new
//      address-keyed container can recreate it.
//   2. Silently changing IPv4 behaviour. The characterisation half of this file
//      records what an IPv4 peer's identity does today, at the value level the
//      unit tests can reach, so a regression in the widening is loud.
//   3. Handing a subsystem an address it cannot represent. Kad is IPv4 behind a
//      documented conversion boundary, and ed2k UDP obfuscation derives its key
//      from a 32-bit address, so an inbound datagram has to be routed by what
//      its peer address can actually reach.
