// `ComputeRemovedIds` decides which files the daemon tells a partial-update client to delete. Both
// ways of getting it wrong are silent: a missed removal leaves an entry in the client's list for
// the life of the connection with no error logged anywhere, and a spurious one deletes a file the
// user still has. Neither shows up as a crash, a failed request, or a wrong-looking packet -- only
// as a list that quietly disagrees with the daemon.
//
// It is a pure function over two sorted vectors, so unlike the surrounding handler it needs no app,
// no daemon and no connected client to exercise.
