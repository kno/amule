// CKnownFile::UpdatePartsInfo() recomputes the complete-sources estimate at most once every 60 s,
// with one exception: the upload list going empty. That transition cannot be deferred, because
// every caller is peer-driven and there is no periodic sweep -- a throttled call there is the last
// one the file ever gets, and the counts keep their values until aMule restarts (issue #1050).
//
// The bypass is guarded so a file already settled at 0 does not re-enter the recompute forever.
// #1052 guarded it on the scalar alone, which was too narrow: Hi is a percentile of the peers'
// self-reported counts and is only floored at the scalar, never tied to it, so scalar 0 with Hi
// non-zero is a reachable and in fact ordinary state -- any peer without extended requests v2
// contributes 0. Since the desktop column and the Web UI detail panel both render "< Hi" whenever
// Lo is 0, that stale Hi is exactly what the user sees (issue #1065).
//
// The predicate lives in its own header precisely so this can be tested: CKnownFile reaches theApp
// and cannot be linked into a unit test.
