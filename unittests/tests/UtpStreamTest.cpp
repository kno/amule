// The buffering between libutp and the eD2k stack.
//
// The property worth the coverage is the would-block contract, because CEMSocket depends on it
// rather than merely tolerating it: 0 bytes with the Blocks flag set means "not yet", 0 bytes with
// an error set means the peer is gone. Getting that backwards disconnects a peer whose send window
// would have opened a millisecond later, and the symptom -- peers dropping under load -- looks
// nothing like its cause.
//
// The other one is the close: libutp's utp_close() must happen exactly once, and a destructor plus
// a DESTROYING callback both closing is a double free that only shows up when a peer leaves at the
// wrong moment.
