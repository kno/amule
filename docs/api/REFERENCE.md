# amuleapi v0 — REST reference

This document is the contract for every REST endpoint exposed by the `amuleapi` daemon under the `/api/v0/` prefix. For the SSE stream see [EVENTS.md](EVENTS.md). For first-run setup see [../QUICKSTART-AMULEAPI.md](../QUICKSTART-AMULEAPI.md).

The API is versioned in the path. Breaking changes ship under `/api/v1/`; `/api/v0/` is frozen against any backwards-incompatible change for the lifetime of the v0 surface.

## Base URL and transport

`amuleapi` serves HTTP on the address declared in `amuleapi.conf[Server]/Port` (default `4713`). The server is HTTP-only by design — terminate TLS in a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, etc.) for any non-loopback deployment. The cookie is deliberately NOT marked `Secure` so the same Set-Cookie works whether the operator runs amuleapi behind TLS or directly. See QUICKSTART for the full bind-vs-listen story.

JSON in, JSON out. Every request body that carries a payload is `Content-Type: application/json`. Every response that carries a payload is `application/json` unless explicitly noted (the SSE endpoint emits `text/event-stream`).

## Authentication

Two carriers, one token. amuleapi mints HS256 JWTs at `/auth/login` and accepts them either as:

- An `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` header (SDK / curl / server-to-server clients).
- An HttpOnly session cookie named `amuleapi_token` (browser clients).

If both arrive on the same request, the bearer header wins. The cookie attributes are `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Path=/api/v0`. Cookie lifetime tracks the JWT's `exp` claim (`Max-Age = expires_at - now`).

### Login response shape

The JSON body of `POST /auth/login` deliberately omits the token by default — XSS that can `fetch('/auth/login', ...)` and read the body would defeat the HttpOnly protection. Browser clients work entirely off the Set-Cookie attached to the response. SDK clients that need the token in the body opt in via either:

- `?type=bearer` query string, or
- `Accept: application/jwt` request header.

| Mode | Body keys | Set-Cookie |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Default (cookie) | `role`, `expires_at`, `expires_at_unix` | yes |
| Bearer opt-in | `token`, `role`, `expires_at`, `expires_at_unix`, `jti` | yes (cookie also goes out so a hybrid client can use either) |

### Role model

Two roles, each gated by its own password:

- `admin` — full surface, including every mutation (`POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`).
- `guest` — read-only surface. Any `admin`-only endpoint returns `403 forbidden`.

A role is implicitly assigned at login based on which password matched; the verified role is encoded in the JWT and surfaced on `/auth/session`.

Guest access is on exactly when a guest password is configured — there is no separate switch. Clearing the guest password is how guest access is turned off.

### Where the passwords live

Both are stored in `${config_dir}/amuleapi-passwords` (mode 0600), each as a salted PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 record rather than a reversible digest. That file is the only store; nothing is kept in `amule.conf`.

Four things write it, and all of them mean the same thing by it:

| Entry point | Used by |
|-------------|---------|
| `amuleapi --set-admin-pass=` / `--set-guest-pass=` | standalone operator |
| `PATCH /auth/passwords` | REST clients and the web frontend |
| aMule → *Preferences → Remote Controls* | monolithic aMule |
| the same panel in amulegui, pushed to amuled over EC | remote GUI |

A change made through any of them takes effect on the next login without restarting amuleapi.

Because the stored form is not reversible, a configured password can never be read back — only replaced. Every interface therefore treats its password field as write-only: leaving it empty means "keep the current password", and `GET /auth/passwords` reports only *whether* each role is configured.

### Changing a password ends other sessions

Any credential change invalidates every token issued before it, whichever entry point made the change. A token whose `iat` predates the credential file's modification time is rejected with `401 unauthorized` (`credentials changed; please sign in again`).

This is what makes rotating a leaked password effective: without it, whoever held the old password would stay signed in for up to the full token lifetime. `PATCH /auth/passwords` issues the caller a replacement token in the same response, so the operator making the change is not signed out by their own request.

### Rate limiting

Two per-IP failure counters, both with sliding-window semantics:

- **Login limiter** — drives `/auth/login`. Defaults are `[Auth]/LoginFailureWindowSeconds=60`, `LoginFailureThreshold=5`, `LoginLockoutSeconds=300`. Configurable per-deployment.
- **Generic 401 limiter** counts every rejected token (bad, missing, expired or revoked) on any other auth-protected endpoint. [`GET /api/v0/version`](#get-apiv0version) is the one exception: authentication there is optional, so a request that presents no credential at all is not counted — otherwise an anonymous poller of a public endpoint could lock real sessions out. A credential that *is* presented and rejected still counts. Defaults are `[Auth]/TokenFailureWindowSeconds=60`, `TokenFailureThreshold=30`, `TokenLockoutSeconds=300`. Configurable per-deployment, like the login limiter: this is the one a browser tab left open overnight actually trips, so an operator serving long-lived clients may want it looser.

When the bucket fills, the next request from that IP returns `429 rate_limited` with a `Retry-After: <seconds>` header. The bucket clears on success or when the lockout expires.

A polling client must treat its first `401` as terminal for that session and stop sending until it has re-authenticated. Restarting amuleapi invalidates every issued token, so a client that keeps a poll loop and an SSE reconnect running against the old cookie spends the generic limiter's whole budget within seconds and locks its own IP out for five minutes. Retrying a `401` never succeeds — only `POST /auth/login` clears it.

### JWT structure

Header: `{"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}`. Payload: `{"role":"admin"|"guest","iat":<unix>,"exp":<unix>,"jti":"<base64url>"}`. The signing secret is auto-generated as 32 random bytes into `${config_dir}/amuleapi-jwt-secret` on first launch (mode 0600). Delete that file and restart to invalidate every issued token. The `jti` claim drives the server-side revocation list (`/auth/logout`), and the `iat` claim drives the credential-change cutoff described above.

## Response model

### Success envelope

Each endpoint documents its own response shape under the endpoint section. List endpoints wrap their array under the resource plural name (`{"downloads": [...]}`, `{"shared": [...]}`) so clients can extend the envelope with sibling metadata without breaking JSON-parser pipelines.

### Mutation responses

One rule for what a mutation answers with: **a mutation carries a body only where the body says something the caller could not otherwise know.** A field echoed back out of the request URL or body is not that, and neither is a constant `ok: true` restating the status code.

That resolves to four shapes:

- **`204 No Content`** - a completed action with nothing to report. Deletes, `POST /auth/logout`, `POST /search/{id}/stop`.
- **`202 Accepted`, no body** - the daemon took the request and the outcome arrives elsewhere: on a later read, on the log channel, or on the SSE stream. Connects, URL fetches, re-hash and reload requests, and the creations whose EC op answers success or failure and nothing more (`POST /servers`, `POST /categories`, `POST /friends`) - a body there could only be reconstructed by scanning the snapshot after an inline refresh and hoping the new record had already landed.
- **`202 Accepted` with the created resource, plus a `Location` header** - the creations where the daemon really does hand one back: [`POST /search`](#post-apiv0search) and the two browse routes, which get an `EC_TAG_SEARCH_ID`. The body is the same row [`GET /search`](#get-apiv0search) lists.
- **`200 OK` with the resource** - a `PATCH`, which answers with the state the caller just produced so no re-read is needed to see it.

Three bodies are deliberate exceptions, because each reports something no later read recovers:

- the per-item [`results` envelope](#bulk-mutations-and-the-results-envelope), which carries a real outcome per input item;
- `message` on the connection-control routes, which is the daemon's own explanation of what it did with the request;
- `ip` / `port` on [`POST /kad/bootstrap`](#post-apiv0kadbootstrap), which reports **which** address the daemon parsed.

### Idempotency

**Every endpoint is idempotent: sending the same request twice leaves the daemon in the state one request would have left it in.** A client library, a proxy or a browser can repeat a request without the caller knowing, so a surface that toggles rather than sets turns an invisible retry into a silent, wrong state change.

In practice that means a mutation names the value it wants rather than the change it wants. `PATCH /downloads/{hash}` with `{"a4af_auto": true}` reaches `true` from either starting point and stays there however many times it arrives; there is deliberately no "flip it" spelling. Where the daemon's own operation was a flip, amuleapi does not paper over it by reading the current value and deciding -- the value goes down to the core, which stores it.

Two things are idempotent without looking it: a `DELETE` of something already gone is a `404` rather than a second delete, and `POST /downloads` with a link already queued is refused per-item in the [`results` envelope](#bulk-mutations-and-the-results-envelope). Both report that the request had no effect, which is the point; neither does the work twice.

The exceptions are the endpoints whose whole purpose is to do something again: `POST /shared_reload`, `POST /shared/{hash}/verify`, the `*/update` fetches, and `POST /search/{id}/more`. Asking twice asks for the work twice, which is what the caller meant.

### IP addresses

**Every IP address on this surface, in either direction, is a dotted-quad string.** `"203.0.113.5"`, never `3405803781`, and never a byte-order the caller has to know about. That covers request bodies, query parameters and response fields alike.

The conversion to and from the host-order integers EC carries happens inside amuleapi. `POST /kad/bootstrap` used to accept a `uint32` alongside the quad, and the two disagreed: the quad parser packed `a.b.c.d` least-significant byte first while the integer was taken verbatim, so `2130706433` (`0x7F000001`, which is what a client computing an IPv4 integer the conventional way writes for `127.0.0.1`) reached the daemon as `1.0.0.127`. Only the quad is accepted now, and the question does not arise.

### Query parameter validation

One rule, everywhere: **a query parameter the server does not understand is a `400 bad_request`, never a silent default.** That covers both halves of "does not understand": a value that will not parse, and a value outside the parameter's documented range.

- Booleans (`include_parts`) accept `1`/`0`, `true`/`false` and `yes`/`no`. Anything else is a `400`.
- Counts (`limit`, `offset`, `tail`, `width`, `interval`, `max_client_versions`, `since_id`) accept decimal digits within the range documented for that parameter. A non-numeric value, a negative one, or one outside the range is a `400` naming the bound.
- An omitted parameter takes the documented default. Only omission does that; an empty value (`?limit=`) is a `400`, not an omission.

Nothing clamps. A count above its cap used to be quietly reduced on some endpoints, so `?limit=99999` returned 500 rows with nothing in the response saying the request had been altered; it is now a rejection, which is the same answer the other endpoints already gave.

### List pagination and sorting

The list endpoints (`GET /downloads`, `/clients`, `/known_clients`, `/shared`, `/servers`, `/friends`, `/chats`, `/categories`, `/search`, the two per-file client routes, and `/search/{id}/results` — the same set as the sortable-fields table below) accept optional query parameters for server-side windowing and ordering, and always return pagination metadata beside the array:

| Param    | Default          | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| `limit`  | *(all items)*    | Maximum items to return, `0`–`500`. Omitted → the full set (pre-pagination behaviour). Non-integer, negative or above `500` → `400 bad_request`. |
| `offset` | `0`              | Items to skip before the window. Non-integer, negative or above `1000000000` → `400 bad_request`. |
| `sort`   | *(native order)* | Field to sort by; endpoint-specific (table below). Unknown field → `400 bad_request`. |
| `order`  | `asc`            | `asc` or `desc`; anything else → `400 bad_request`. |

Sorting is applied to the full filtered set **before** slicing, so pagination is stable across requests (a stable sort — equal keys keep native order). The response adds three sibling keys to the array:

```json
{ "shared": [ ... ], "total": 8431, "offset": 100, "limit": 50 }
```

- `total` — item count after any endpoint-specific filter (e.g. `/clients?filter=`), before slicing.
- `offset` — the offset applied.
- `limit` — the page size the request asked for, or `null` when it asked for none. It is not the row count: that is `total`. It reported the row count once, which no caller could reuse as a page size, since re-sending it is a `400` as soon as the list is longer than the `500` cap.

Omitting all four parameters preserves the previous response exactly, plus the additive `total` / `offset` / `limit` keys.

**Sortable fields per endpoint:**

| Endpoint              | `sort` values |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| `GET /downloads`      | `name`, `size`, `progress`, `speed`, `status` |
| `GET /clients`        | `name`, `software` |
| `GET /downloads/{hash}/clients`<br>`GET /shared/{hash}/clients` | same keys as `/clients` |
| `GET /known_clients`  | `name`, `software`, `first_seen`, `last_seen`, `sessions`, `total_uploaded`, `total_downloaded` |
| `GET /shared`         | `name`, `size` |
| `GET /servers`        | `name`, `users`, `ping`, `files` |
| `GET /friends`        | `name`, `online` |
| `GET /chats`          | `last_message_at`, `name` |
| `GET /search/{id}/results` | `name`, `size`, `sources`, `rating`, `directory` |
| `GET /search`         | `search_id`, `query`, `started_at`, `result_count` |
| `GET /categories`     | `index`, `name` |

### Bulk mutations and the `results` envelope

Every mutation that operates on more than one item (`POST /downloads`, `PATCH /downloads`, `DELETE /downloads`, `PATCH /shared`, `POST /downloads_clear_completed`, `PUT /share_directories`) reports one entry per input item under a unified `results` array, so a client submitting N items learns the fate of each rather than an aggregate counter or a first-error-only summary:

```json
{
  "results": [
    { "id": "8b54a3c2…", "ok": true },
    { "id": "0011…",     "ok": false, "error": { "code": "not_found", "message": "no download with that hash" } }
  ]
}
```

- `id` — the item key: the MD4 hash for `/downloads` and `/shared`, or the submitted ed2k link for `POST /downloads`.
- `ok` — whether that single item's mutation succeeded.
- `error` — present only when `ok` is false; same `{code,message}` shape as the top-level [error envelope](#error-envelope).

Processing is **best-effort per item** — each item is an independent EC roundtrip, so a mid-batch failure does not abort the rest. The **HTTP status aggregates** the batch:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `200 OK` (`202 Accepted` for the async `POST /downloads` add) | every item succeeded |
| `207 Multi-Status` | a mix — inspect each `results[].ok` |
| `503 ec_unavailable` | *every* item failed because the daemon was unreachable |

A malformed **request** (missing/empty `hashes`, an invalid patch field) is still a top-level `400 bad_request` and returns the plain error envelope, not `results`. The `hashes` array is capped at 500 entries.

### Unknown values

A field whose value is not known is `null`, not a sentinel. `remaining_time` is `null` rather than `-1` when there is no ETA to compute; `last_upload`, `shared_since` and `last_seen_complete` are `null` rather than `0` when a file has never uploaded, has never been seen complete, or its `known.met` entry predates the field. On a peer row, `available_parts` is `null` when that peer has not reported its part map -- distinct from `0`, which is a real answer and what a fresh source looks like -- and `remote_queue_rank` is `null` when the peer's queue is full, which the daemon signals with a `65535` sentinel rather than a position.

A key is **omitted** only where absence itself is the meaning: something the daemon never reported, rather than something known to be absent. `started_at` on [`GET /search`](#get-apiv0search) is the example, missing for a search this process did not start, and `result_count` is missing when the daemon is too old to send it, which has to stay distinguishable from a search that found nothing.

So: `null` means "no value", an absent key means "not reported", and neither is ever spelled `0` or `-1`.

The rule now reaches the whole surface rather than just the download and shared objects. Keys that used to disappear and are `null` instead: `name`, `ip`, `port`, `kad_port`, `country_code`, `software`, `version`, `source_origin`, `obfuscation`, `first_seen` and `sessions` on [`GET /known_clients`](#get-apiv0known_clients); `part_progress_percent` and `available_parts` on the peer rows and the `client_*` events; `client_ecid` on [`GET /search`](#get-apiv0search); `last_message` on [`GET /chats`](#get-apiv0chats); `token`, `label_value` and `extra` on the statistics tree; and `media` everywhere it appears.

`media` is the one place this reaches an **object** rather than a scalar, so a client tests `media === null` before reaching into it -- which it had to do regardless, since the object's own fields can be absent.

Four keys stay omitted, because for them absence really is the meaning: `started_at` and `result_count` on [`GET /search`](#get-apiv0search) as described above, `key` on a statistics node (absent from a daemon too old to send it), and `parts` under [`?include_parts=true`](#get-apiv0downloadshashclients) -- there the caller opted in, so the key's absence answers a question they did not ask.

### Priority levels

`priority` appears on four resources and accepts three different sets. The differences are deliberate rather than drift, and they reflect what the daemon can actually store:

| Resource | Accepted |
|---|---|
| Downloads (`PATCH /downloads`, `PATCH /downloads/{hash}`) | `low`, `normal`, `high`, `auto` |
| Shared files (`PATCH /shared`, `PATCH /shared/{hash}`) | `very_low`, `low`, `normal`, `high`, `release`, `auto` |
| Categories (`POST /categories`, `PATCH /categories/{index}`) | `low`, `normal`, `high`, `auto` |
| Servers (`PATCH /servers/{ecid}`) | `low`, `normal`, `high` |

`very_low` and `release` are upload-side levels only: the `.part.met` loader clamps anything outside low/normal/high back to normal on restart, so a download pinned to one of them would silently lose it. Categories apply their priority to member files as a *download* priority, so they take the download set. Servers have three levels and no `auto`.

A rejection names the set that endpoint accepts, so sending a wrong value tells you the right ones. Note that a file which is both downloading and shared carries two independent priorities from the two sets, and changing one does not affect the other.

**Categories read wider than they write.** The table above is the *write* domain. A category's `priority` is formatted on read from the same six-level file set as downloads and shared files, so `GET /api/v0/categories` can in principle report `very_low` or `release` -- values `POST` and `PATCH` will refuse with a `400`. Read-modify-write on such a category therefore fails on a field the client never touched.

Reaching it takes a category whose stored priority was not set through this API or the desktop: the desktop's category priority control offers only Low / Normal / High / Auto, and `CDownloadQueue::SetCatPrio` applies whatever it is given as a *download* priority, which is the same four. A hand-edited `amule.conf`, or another client, is what it would take.

The asymmetry is left in place deliberately. Clamping on read would have the API report `high` for a category the daemon holds as `release`, and the client's write-back would then persist that lie; widening the write domain would let the value survive one session and be clamped to normal by the partfile loader on the next restart, which is the silent rewrite the download set refuses those two levels to avoid. Between two ways of quietly changing a user's setting and one documented sentence, the sentence wins.

### Localization and number formatting

The API is a machine contract: **all API text is English and all numbers use the C locale** (a `.` decimal separator, no digit grouping), independent of the `amuleapi`/`amuled` locale or the `--locale` option. Localization is a client concern.

- **Text** — enum-like fields (download status, priorities, upload/connection states) and the `/stats/tree` node label templates cross the wire in English. Strings relayed from amuled (for example `error.message` on an `amuled_rejected` failure, or connect/disconnect `message` fields) are passed through verbatim and are never translated by amuleapi.
- **Numbers** — every JSON number is C-locale. `/stats/tree` values are raw and typed (seconds, bytes, bytes/second, …) so the client does its own formatting and localization; nothing arrives pre-formatted with a locale's decimal separator.

Explicitly **out of scope** (not English-normalized): `GET /api/v0/logs/amule` content — daemon log lines are gettext-translated at the daemon's locale by nature — and user/external data such as file names, category names and comments, and server names and descriptions.

### Error envelope

Every non-2xx response carries the same shape:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "machine_readable_token",
    "message": "human-readable explanation"
  }
}
```

`code` is stable across releases; alert on `code`, not on `message`. The catalog at the bottom of this file lists every code emitted by the dispatcher.

### ETag and conditional GET

Every `GET` or `HEAD` that returns `200` carries an `ETag` header. Clients that re-fetch should send `If-None-Match: "<etag>"` and accept `304 Not Modified` (no content, ETag preserved). `If-None-Match` accepts `*`, a comma-separated list, and weak `W/"..."` validators.

The validator is memoized for two collections only, `/downloads` and `/shared`, keyed on the target plus a revision that every writer of those bodies advances. Repeated GETs between changes skip the body hash; everything else on the surface is hashed per request. Eligibility is opt-in rather than exclusion-based, because a resource qualifies only if its body moves solely when the state moves AND is identical for every caller. Anything with its own cache, an append-only mirror, a refresh-on-read, a live daemon roundtrip per request, or a per-caller body is simply not in the set. `/auth/session` is per-caller and is additionally marked `Cache-Control: private, no-store` (see below).

`HEAD` returns the same headers as the equivalent `GET`, including `ETag` and a `Content-Length` describing the body the `GET` would return, and no content -- on every status, not only `200`. The one exception is [`GET /api/v0/events`](EVENTS.md): its body is an unbounded chunked stream, so a `HEAD` there reports the stream's headers and no length. Note that this is why `curl -X HEAD` appears to hang or fail: `-X` only changes the method string, leaving curl waiting for a body that a HEAD response correctly never sends. Use `curl --head` (or `-I`).

A validator names one representation, not one URL. When a response is compressed the `ETag` carries a `-gzip` suffix, so the gzipped and identity forms of the same resource never share a validator, and an `If-None-Match` is only a hit against the form the current request would actually receive. A client that stored `"abc123-gzip"` and then re-fetches with `Accept-Encoding: identity` gets a `200` with the identity body, which is the correct answer -- the stored entry does not describe it. Store the validator alongside the encoding you received, which is what an HTTP cache does anyway.

**Caching policy.** Any request that presented credentials -- a bearer token or the session cookie -- is answered `Cache-Control: private` with `Cookie` added to `Vary`. `private` keeps the response out of shared caches, while still letting the client's own cache hold it and revalidate with `If-None-Match`; `no-store` would forbid that too and there would be no stored entry left for the conditional GET above to match. [`GET /api/v0/auth/session`](#get-apiv0authsession) is the deliberate exception and is `private, no-store`: it carries the credential itself, which should not be written down anywhere. Requests without credentials are left cacheable. Static assets are the other case. The WebUI shell and its bundles are byte-identical for every caller, so an authenticated request for one is answered exactly as an anonymous request is, and they carry `public, no-cache`. Both tokens do work. `no-cache` means revalidate every time -- not "do not store": the copy stays cached and an unchanged bundle costs one conditional request answered `304`. `public` is what lets a shared cache in front of the daemon keep one copy rather than one per caller: RFC 9111 §3.5 bars a shared cache from reusing a response to a request that carried an `Authorization` header unless the response is marked `public`, `must-revalidate` or `s-maxage`, and `no-cache` is not on that list. The browser WebUI is not the case that engages this -- it authenticates by cookie, which is why the authenticated stamp above adds `Cookie` to `Vary` rather than relying on §3.5 at all. A bearer-token client fetching the same shell is the case that engages it.

There is no freshness lifetime on them because these filenames carry no content hash: `index.html`, `app.js` and `app.css` keep their names across a rebuild, so a `max-age` would let an upgraded daemon keep serving the old shell until the entry expired, and -- since each asset expires on its own clock -- pair a new shell with an old bundle. `must-revalidate` would not prevent that: it governs what a cache may do once an entry is *already* stale (RFC 9111 §5.2.2.2), not whether it may be used while fresh.

The [country flags](#get-flagscodepng) take the opposite trade and keep `public, max-age=86400`. That artwork is compiled into the daemon, so it changes only with a new build, and a peer list is a page full of `<img>` tags: a day of freshness turns those into cache hits instead of one conditional request per distinct country per reload. The `max-age` is what bounds how long an upgraded daemon can keep serving the old art -- a day, not forever.

Mutations (`POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE`) and error responses are never ETag-stamped; the body always ships.

### CORS

If `amuleapi.conf[Server]/AllowCORS=1`:

- Every response carries `Vary: Origin`.
- The origin is echoed in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` if either the allowlist is empty (any-origin echo) or the request's `Origin` header matches a configured entry.
- Allowed responses also carry `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` and `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag, Allow, Retry-After` so cookie-auth clients can read the validator, the supported-method list from a `405`, and the back-off hint from a `429` or `503`, from JS.
- Preflight (`OPTIONS` with `Access-Control-Request-Method`) returns `204` with `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type, If-None-Match, Last-Event-ID`, and `Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400`.

### Path validation

The dispatcher rejects paths containing NUL, encoded NUL (`%00`), encoded `..` (any case of `%2e%2e`), or a literal `..` segment with `400 bad_request` before routing. Defence-in-depth against a future endpoint that admits path captures.

**Trailing slash.** Under `/api/`, one trailing `/` is stripped before routing, so `/api/v0/status/` and `/api/v0/status` are the same request. Exactly one is stripped: `//` is a malformed path rather than a synonym, so `/api/v0/downloads//` does not reach `/api/v0/downloads`. The rule stops at the API prefix: a static asset path is a filesystem path, where a trailing slash means a directory.

**Empty path captures.** A segment standing in for a `{capture}` cannot be empty. Every capture names a resource (a hash, an ECID, an index, an address), so a path that binds one to the empty string matches no route and is `404 not_found`, rather than reaching a handler and being rejected there with whatever status that endpoint happens to use.

### Request size limits

- HTTP header section: hard cap 16 KiB. Exceeding it is `431 headers_too_large`.
- Request body: hard cap 1 MiB. Exceeding it is `413 payload_too_large`.
- A request that is not fully sent within 10 s is `408 request_timeout`.
- JSON nesting: `>32` opening `{` or `[` tokens → `400 bad_request`. Applies to every body parser and to the JWT header/payload sections of bearer tokens.

The first three are answered by the transport before any handler runs, and each closes the connection after answering, with `Connection: close` on the response.

## Endpoint catalog

The catalog below is grouped by resource. Each entry documents:

- **Method + path**
- **Auth** — `NONE`, `GUEST` (any authenticated role), or `ADMIN`
- **Query parameters** if any
- **Request body schema** for endpoints that consume one
- **Response status + body**
- **Error codes the endpoint can emit** beyond the universal `unauthorized` / `forbidden` / `rate_limited` (those are documented in §Response model above and are not repeated per endpoint)

Curl examples use `$HOST` for `127.0.0.1:4713` and `$TOKEN` for a previously-issued bearer.

### System

#### `GET /api/v0/health`

**Auth:** `NONE`. A probe has to work before anyone holds a token.

```json
{ "status": "ok", "ec_connected": true, "snapshot": true }
```

**Liveness, not readiness.** The status is `200` whenever the HTTP server is answering, so a container, systemd or load-balancer probe never restarts a healthy process just because `amuled` went away. Readiness is in the body instead: `ec_connected` is the live EC link and `snapshot` is whether the first refresher tick has landed. A caller that wants readiness keys on those two fields; a caller that wants liveness keys on the status code.

The handler touches no EC. amuleapi serialises EC through one worker, so a probe that waited on the daemon could block behind an unrelated slow mutation and time out, reporting the service as down when it is merely busy.

`HEAD` is supported. Any other method is `405` with `Allow: GET, HEAD`.

**Conditional requests.** The body is small and changes only when those two flags change, so the usual `ETag` applies and a probe that sends `If-None-Match` will get `304 Not Modified`. That is a healthy answer, not an outage. A checker that treats anything other than `200` as failure should either not send the header or accept `304`.

#### `GET /api/v0/version`

**Auth:** `NONE` for the identity fields, so an unauthenticated caller can negotiate versions. Use [`GET /api/v0/health`](#get-apiv0health) for liveness probing rather than this endpoint.

The `update` object is **omitted unless the request is authenticated**: it reports whether this daemon is running an outdated build, which is not something an unauthenticated caller on a deliberately reachable interface should learn. A client showing an "update available" banner is already authenticated when it does. Sending no credential is not an error here — the response is `200` with the identity fields, and it does not count against the [generic 401 limiter](#rate-limiting). Sending a *bad* one is also `200` without `update`, but does count.

```sh
curl -s http://$HOST/api/v0/version
```

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "name": "amuleapi",
  "api_version": "v0",
  "amule_version": "2.4.0-29-g...",
  "daemon_version": "2.4.0-29-g...",
  "update": {
    "check_enabled": true,
    "checked": true,
    "latest_version": "3.0.1",
    "update_available": false,
    "last_checked": 1783675590
  }
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Always `"amuleapi"`. |
| `api_version` | REST contract version served on this path (`"v0"`). |
| `amule_version` | amuleapi's **own** build version. |
| `daemon_version` | Version of the **connected amuled**, from the EC handshake. Empty string when EC is not (yet) connected, or when the daemon is old enough not to advertise it. Normally equal to `amule_version` (both are built from the same source tree), but they can differ if a mismatched amuleapi is pointed at a different amuled. |
| `update` | Update-availability, **relayed from the connected daemon** — amuleapi never contacts GitHub itself. See the sub-table. |

The `update` object:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `check_enabled` | `true` only when the daemon can check **and** is configured to: built with `ENABLE_VERSION_CHECK` **and** its `NewVersionCheck` preference on. `false` for OS-package builds, the preference off, or a pre-3.1 daemon. When `false`, a client should show nothing. |
| `checked` | `true` once the daemon has completed at least one check this session (so `latest_version` is known). The daemon checks at startup; use `POST /api/v0/version/check` to trigger a fresh one. |
| `latest_version` | Latest release string (e.g. `"3.0.1"`); empty string when not yet checked or unavailable. |
| `update_available` | `true` when a newer release exists, `false` when up to date, `null` when unknown (not yet checked or disabled). |
| `last_checked` | Unix time (seconds) the last check completed; `null` when never checked. Useful because checks are startup-only unless re-triggered. |

#### `POST /api/v0/version/check`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Triggers an on-demand version check **on the daemon** (amuleapi does not fetch GitHub itself). Fire-and-forget: the request returns as soon as the daemon accepts it, and the result appears on a subsequent `GET /api/v0/version` once the async check completes. Throttled by the daemon to respect GitHub's rate limit.

```sh
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://$HOST/api/v0/version/check
```

**Response:** `202 Accepted`, with no body. The check runs asynchronously; the outcome arrives on the `logs` channel and in [`GET /api/v0/version`](#get-apiv0version).

**Errors:**

| Status | `error.code` | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `409` | `update_check_unavailable` | The daemon can't check (`update.check_enabled` is `false`). |
| `429` | `update_check_throttled` | A check ran too recently; retry shortly. |
| `503` | `ec_unavailable` | The EC round-trip to amuled failed, or the first snapshot has not landed yet. |

The snapshot gate matters at startup: `version_check_available` defaults to false, so before the first EC tick this route used to answer `409 update_check_unavailable`, blaming the daemon's configuration for amuleapi not having read it yet. It answers `503` there now, which is the condition a client can retry.

#### `GET /api/v0/status`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

Returns the current connection state, network state, and headline throughput counters.

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://$HOST/api/v0/status
```

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "ec_connected": true,
  "ed2k": {
    "state": "connected",
    "high_id": true,
    "user_id": 1234567890,
    "public_ip": "210.2.150.73",
    "connected_since": 1751000000,
    "server_name": "eMule Server",
    "server_ip": "203.0.113.5",
    "server_port": 4242,
    "network": { "users": 312000, "files": 75000000 }
  },
  "kad": {
    "state": "connected",
    "firewalled_tcp": false,
    "connected_since": 1751000000,
    "network": { "users": 5400000, "files": 1400000000, "nodes": 2400 }
  },
  "speeds": {
    "download_bps": 4500000,
    "upload_bps": 50000,
    "download_overhead_bps": 8700,
    "upload_overhead_bps": 1100
  },
  "disk": { "temp_free_bytes": 48318382080, "incoming_free_bytes": 48318382080 },
  "queue": { "upload_clients_waiting": 12, "download_sources_total": 1843 }
}
```

`ec_connected` is `false` while amuleapi can't reach the underlying amuled. Most other endpoints return `503 ec_unavailable` in that state.

`ed2k.connected_since` / `kad.connected_since` are unix timestamps of the most recent connect, `0` while not connected — gate on `ed2k.state` / `kad.state` rather than trust a `0` timestamp alone.

**`kad.firewalled_tcp` is named for its transport.** It is the TCP half of a pair; [`GET /api/v0/kad`](#get-apiv0kad) reports `firewalled_udp` alongside it. The two are independent measurements taken by different mechanisms, not a verdict and a refinement of it. See the `/kad` field table for what each one measures and how their defaults differ.

**Our eD2k identity.** `ed2k.user_id` is the id the connected server assigned us, and `ed2k.high_id` is `true` when it is a HighID — an id `>= 16777216`, the same threshold the peer-side `high_id` on [`GET /clients/{ecid}`](#get-apiv0clientsecid) uses. A HighID **is** our public IPv4 packed into that integer, which is where `ed2k.public_ip` comes from; a LowID is a small number the server picked for a firewalled client and carries no address, so `public_ip` is `""` there.

While disconnected `user_id` is `0`, `public_ip` is `""` and `high_id` is `false` — so read `high_id` **together with `state`**: `false` means "LowID" only once `state` is `"connected"`, and means "no id yet" otherwise. The transient `0xffffffff` the daemon sends mid-connect is normalized to `0` and never appears.

**`ed2k.user_id` is not the same encoding as a peer's `user_id_hybrid`.** [`GET /api/v0/clients/{ecid}`](#get-apiv0clientsecid) reports `user_id_hybrid` for a remote peer, and the similar name invites the assumption that the two are interchangeable. They are not. Ours is stored exactly as the server sent it and is read least-significant-byte-first to produce `public_ip`; a peer's HighID is **byte-swapped** on the way in. A consumer that compares the two values, or feeds one through the other's IP decoder, gets a reversed address. The `>= 16777216` HighID threshold *is* common to both; the byte order is not.

**Overhead is additive.** `speeds.download_overhead_bps` / `upload_overhead_bps` are protocol and control traffic, counted **separately** from `download_bps` / `upload_bps` rather than being part of them — the desktop shows them as a second figure in parentheses. Both are `0` when the daemon reports nothing.

**Disk figures may be `null`.** `disk.temp_free_bytes` is free space on the filesystem holding the part files, `disk.incoming_free_bytes` where finished downloads land. Either is `null` when the daemon has no figure — the first seconds after startup, or a directory it cannot stat, such as an unreachable network mount. `null` rather than `0`, because `0` would read as a full disk.

The two are **equal whenever Temp and Incoming share a filesystem**, which is the default layout — that is correct, not a bug. `incoming_free_bytes` describes the **default category's** incoming directory; a category pointed at another filesystem is not covered, because the daemon publishes no per-category figure.

To reproduce the desktop's low-space warning, compare `temp_free_bytes` against the bytes still to write across the queue (`size - size_done` summed over [`GET /downloads`](#get-apiv0downloads)), or against the `files.min_free_space_mb` preference when `files.stop_on_low_disk_space` is on. Note that preference is in **MiB** while these fields are bytes.

**Errors:** `503 ec_unavailable` if amuleapi hasn't received its first EC snapshot yet.

### Authentication

#### `POST /api/v0/auth/login`

**Auth:** `NONE`

Mints a JWT for the role that matched the supplied password.

**Query parameters:** `?type=bearer` (optional) — opt into the bearer body response shape. Equivalent to sending `Accept: application/jwt`.

**Body:**

```json
{ "password": "string" }
```

**Default (cookie) request:**

```sh
curl -i -X POST http://$HOST/api/v0/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"password":"adminpass"}'
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Set-Cookie: amuleapi_token=eyJhbGciOi...; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Path=/api/v0; Max-Age=86400
Content-Type: application/json

{"role":"admin","expires_at":"2026-06-20T11:00:00Z","expires_at_unix":1781434800}
```

**Bearer opt-in request:**

```sh
curl -s -X POST "http://$HOST/api/v0/auth/login?type=bearer" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"password":"adminpass"}'
```

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOi...",
  "role": "admin",
  "expires_at": "2026-06-20T11:00:00Z",
  "expires_at_unix": 1781434800,
  "jti": "b3iY9oA1tUW2pK..."
}
```

**Errors:**

- `400 bad_request` — body missing/non-object/missing `password`/non-string `password`.
- `401 invalid_credentials` — password didn't match any configured role.
- `429 rate_limited` — login limiter armed; `Retry-After` set.
- `503 login_disabled` — no admin and no guest password configured.

#### `POST /api/v0/auth/logout`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

Adds the bearer's `jti` to the server-side revocation list (TTL = JWT's `exp`) and emits a clear-cookie. Idempotent: a token that is already revoked still gets `204` so a double-tap on a logout button doesn't surface a confusing "session expired" toast.

`204 No Content`, no body: the clear-cookie header is the whole result, and the `{"ok": true}` this used to send only restated the status code.

```sh
curl -i -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://$HOST/api/v0/auth/logout
```

**Response headers:** `Set-Cookie: amuleapi_token=; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Path=/api/v0; Max-Age=0`.

#### `GET /api/v0/auth/session`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

Returns the verified bearer's role and expiry. Useful for SPA bootstrap.

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://$HOST/api/v0/auth/session
```

```json
{
  "role": "admin",
  "exp": "2026-06-20T11:00:00Z",
  "exp_unix": 1781434800,
  "jti": "b3iY9oA1tUW2pK..."
}
```

---

#### `GET /api/v0/auth/passwords`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Reports which roles have a password configured. The passwords themselves are stored irreversibly and are never returned.

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://$HOST/api/v0/auth/passwords
```

```json
{
  "admin_set": true,
  "guest_enabled": false
}
```

`guest_enabled` is simply whether a guest password exists.

---

#### `PATCH /api/v0/auth/passwords`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Changes the admin password, and turns guest access on or off or changes its password.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `current_password` | string | **Required.** The admin password as it is now. |
| `admin_password` | string | New admin password. Omit to leave it unchanged. |
| `guest_password` | string | New guest password. Implies `guest_enabled: true` unless that field says otherwise. Omit to leave it unchanged. |
| `guest_enabled` | bool | `false` clears the guest password, turning guest access off. Omit to leave the current state. |

Omitting a field means "leave it alone" — the same rule every other interface follows, and a necessary one, because a client cannot read a stored password back in order to resend it.

`current_password` is required even though the caller already holds an admin token: a stolen token alone should not be enough to lock the real operator out. It is checked against the same per-IP limiter as `/auth/login`, so this is not a softer place to guess passwords.

```sh
curl -s -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"current_password":"old-secret","admin_password":"new-secret"}' \
    "http://$HOST/api/v0/auth/passwords?type=bearer"
```

```json
{
  "admin_set": true,
  "guest_enabled": false,
  "other_sessions_revoked": true,
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...",
  "role": "admin",
  "expires_at": "2026-06-21T11:00:00Z",
  "expires_at_unix": 1781521200,
  "jti": "9pQ2xR7mLk4vTn..."
}
```

The response re-issues the caller's session — same shape and same `?type=bearer` / `Accept: application/jwt` opt-in as `/auth/login`, cookie included. Every *other* session is now invalid, which is what `other_sessions_revoked` reports. Clients that ignore the new token will get `401 unauthorized` on their next request.

**Errors**

| Status | Code | Cause |
|--------|------|-------|
| `400` | `bad_request` | no changeable field given; a password field is not a string; `admin_password` empty (the admin role cannot be removed); `guest_password` sent together with `guest_enabled: false` |
| `403` | `invalid_credentials` | `current_password` is not the admin password |
| `403` | `forbidden` | the token is a guest token |
| `429` | `rate_limited` | too many failed `current_password` attempts from this IP |

### Downloads

#### `GET /api/v0/downloads`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

Lists the current transfer queue. Completed entries (status `completed`) are excluded by default — they live in amuled's separate "awaiting clear" list and surfacing them inline confuses queue dashboards.

**Query parameters:**

- `status=active|all|completed` -- which part of the queue to list. Defaults to `active`, which is what is currently transferring; `completed` selects only finished downloads awaiting a clear, and `all` is both. Anything else is a `400`. This replaced `include_completed`, which could not express completed-only; sending it now is a `400` naming the replacement.

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://$HOST/api/v0/downloads"
```

```json
{
  "downloads": [
    {
      "hash":          "8b54a3c2...",
      "name":          "ubuntu-26.04-desktop-amd64.iso",
      "ed2k_link":     "ed2k://|file|ubuntu...|3825..|8b54...|/",
      "size":          3825205248,
      "size_done":     1142000000,
      "size_xfer":     1102450000,
      "speed_bps":     4500000,
      "status":        "downloading",
      "priority":      "normal",
      "priority_auto": true,
      "category":      0,
      "sources":  { "total": 217, "not_current": 23, "transferring": 8, "a4af": 4 },
      "progress": { "percent": 29.85 },
      "kad_comment_search_running": false,
      "hashing_progress": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

`status` is one of `"downloading"`, `"waiting"`, `"hashing"`, `"allocating"`, `"paused"`, `"stopped"`, `"completing"` or `"completed"`. `"stopped"` is a paused file that has also dropped all its sources and reset its Kad source search (set via `PATCH` `status:"stopped"`); it is distinct from `"paused"`, which retains its sources.

`priority` is the download priority — one of `"low"`, `"normal"` or `"high"` — and `priority_auto` is `true` when amuled is deriving that level automatically. Downloads never report `very_low` or `release`; those are shared/upload-side levels only. A file that is simultaneously downloading and shared carries two independent priorities: this download priority, and the upload priority reported by [`GET /api/v0/shared`](#get-apiv0shared). Changing one does not affect the other.

The list shape omits `progress.parts` to keep large libraries compact. Use the detail endpoint for per-part state.

`kad_comment_search_running` is `true` while an on-demand Kad notes lookup is in flight for the file (started by [`POST /downloads/{hash}/comments`](#post-apiv0downloadshashcomments)); it flips back to `false` when the lookup finishes. Because it lives on the download object, a client can watch the `download_updated` SSE event for the start → finish transition instead of polling.

`hashing_progress` is the number of parts hashed so far by a pass running over the file — a `hashing` status, an [`AICH`](#post-apiv0sharedhashverify) hashset rebuild — and `0` when nothing is hashing. It is a count of completed parts, not the index of the part in flight, so it runs `0` → `part_count`; divide by `part_count` (from the detail endpoint, or `ceil(size / 9728000)`) for a percentage.

The SSE `download_added` / `download_updated` event payload matches this object byte-for-byte.

**Errors:** `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `GET /api/v0/downloads/{hash}`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

Detail view for a single partfile. `{hash}` is the 32-char MD4 hex hash (case-insensitive).

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/downloads/8b54a3c20fae9e4b9f7e0c2c8c01b6b1"
```

Same envelope as the list item, plus the detail-only fields below (all omitted from the `GET /downloads` list to keep it lean):

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `progress.parts` | array | One entry per ~9.28 MiB chunk: `{ "state": string, "sources": int }` — `state` is `transferring`/`complete`/`empty`/`corrupt`/…, `sources` counts peers offering that chunk. |
| `last_seen_complete` | int \| null | Unix ts a complete copy was last seen across sources; `null` when no complete copy has ever been seen, or the daemon does not report it. |
| `last_changed` | int | Unix ts the partfile last received data. |
| `download_active_time` | int | Seconds spent actively downloading. |
| `available_part_count` | int | Number of parts available across the current sources. |
| `part_count` | int | Total parts, `ceil(size / 9.28 MiB)`. |
| `remaining_time` | int \| null | ETA in seconds, or `null` when stalled or paused (speed ≈ 0) and there is nothing to compute from. |
| `lost_to_corruption` | int | Bytes discarded to corruption. |
| `gained_by_compression` | int | Bytes saved by on-the-wire compression. |
| `saved_by_ich` | int | Packets recovered by Intelligent Corruption Handling. |
| `aich_hash` | string | AICH master hash (hex); `""` if not yet computed. |
| `met_file` | string | The partfile's `.part` control-file basename (e.g. `001.part`). `""` once the download has completed (status `completed`, before `clear_completed`). |
| `path` | string | Directory the file lives in on disk — the Temp directory while downloading, the destination directory once completed. |
| `partmet_id` | int | Numeric partfile id. |
| `queued_count` | int | Clients waiting on this file's upload queue. |
| `comment` | string | The user's own comment on this file (`""` if none). |
| `rating` | int | The user's own rating, `0`–`5` (`0` = unrated). See the [rating scale](#get-apiv0downloadshashcomments). |
| `a4af_auto` | bool | Whether automatic A4AF source-swapping is on for this file. See [A4AF](#post-apiv0downloadshasha4af). |
| `media` | object | Audio/video metadata — see [Media metadata](#media-metadata). **Omitted entirely** when the file has no probed metadata. |

**Errors:** `404 not_found` (no partfile with that hash), `503 ec_unavailable`.

##### Media metadata

The `media` object (on both `GET /downloads/{hash}` and `GET /shared/{hash}`) carries the audio/video metadata amuled probed for the file. It is **omitted entirely** when the file has not been probed (a non-media file, or one probing hasn't reached yet).

```json
"media": {
  "length_s": 5400,
  "bitrate": 1500,
  "codec": "h264",
  "artist": "…",
  "album": "…",
  "title": "…"
}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `length_s` | int | Duration in seconds. |
| `bitrate` | int | Bitrate (kbps). |
| `codec` | string | Codec identifier (e.g. `"h264"`). |
| `artist` / `album` / `title` | string | Tag metadata; `""` when the file carries none. |

#### `GET /api/v0/downloads/{hash}/comments`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

The comments and ratings this download's **sources** report for the file (the desktop "Show all comments" list). Downloads-only — a completed/shared file has no live source list.

The list also includes any **Kad community notes** retrieved on demand via `POST` on this same path (see below). A Kad note's `username` is the responding node's IP address when the note carries one, otherwise the placeholder `Kad user`.

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/downloads/8b54a3c2…/comments"
```

```json
{
  "count": 2,
  "kad_comment_search_running": false,
  "comments": [
    { "username": "alice",    "filename": "Some.Movie.mkv", "rating": 5, "comment": "great quality" },
    { "username": "Kad user", "filename": "some_movie.avi", "rating": 4, "comment": "" }
  ]
}
```

`kad_comment_search_running` is `true` while an on-demand Kad notes lookup (triggered by the `POST` below) is in flight; poll until it returns to `false` to know the lookup finished. Kad notes appear as ordinary entries whose `username` is the responding node's IP (or `Kad user` when the note carries no IP).

A per-source `rating` of `-1` means the source left a comment but no rating. Rating scale (from the desktop `GetRateString()`):

| value | meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Not rated |
| 1 | Invalid / Corrupt / Fake |
| 2 | Poor |
| 3 | Fair |
| 4 | Good |
| 5 | Excellent |

**Errors:** `404 not_found` (no download with that hash), `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/downloads/{hash}/comments`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Trigger an on-demand **Kad notes** lookup for this download (the desktop "Get from Kad" button). aMule asks the Kad network for community ratings/comments keyed on the file hash. The lookup is **asynchronous** on the daemon (it can take up to ~45 s); this call returns immediately with `202 Accepted`, and the retrieved notes then show up in the `GET` list above. Poll the `GET` endpoint to observe them arrive.

```sh
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/downloads/8b54a3c2…/comments"
```

**Response:** `202 Accepted`, with no body. The lookup is asynchronous; results appear on the download's `comments` and via `kad_comment_search_running`.

**Errors:** `403 forbidden` (guest token — the lookup makes the daemon do network work, so it is `ADMIN`-only), `404 not_found` (no download with that hash), `503 ec_unavailable`, `400 amuled_rejected` (daemon refused, e.g. Kad not connected).

#### `GET /api/v0/downloads/{hash}/filenames`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

The distinct filenames this download's **sources** report for it, each with how many sources use that name (the desktop "File Names" list). Downloads-only — needs a live source list. Pair it with `PATCH /downloads/{hash}` `{ "name": … }` to implement the desktop "Takeover" flow (pick a source name, then rename).

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/downloads/8b54a3c2…/filenames"
```

```json
{
  "filenames": [
    { "name": "Some.Movie.2024.mkv", "count": 7 },
    { "name": "some_movie.mkv", "count": 2 }
  ]
}
```

**Errors:** `404 not_found` (no download with that hash), `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `GET /api/v0/downloads/{hash}/clients` / `GET /api/v0/shared/{hash}/clients`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

The peers of one file: sources serving it to us, peers pulling it from us, and — on the downloads side — A4AF sources parked on another file. Replaces the client-side join of the global `/clients` list against `download_file_hash` / `upload_file_hash`, which could never produce the A4AF rows.

Each entry is the [`/clients`](#get-apiv0clients) list object plus three keys:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `role` | this peer's live relation to **this** file: `"source"` (serves it to us, including queued), `"peer"` (pulls it from us), `"both"`, `"none"` |
| `a4af` | `true` for a source parked on another file — the desktop's A4AF row |
| `parts` | the peer's per-part bitmap, **only** when `?include_parts=true` |

`role` and `a4af` are orthogonal: a pure A4AF row is `role: "none"`, `a4af: true`, but a peer can be parked on another file *and* be pulling this one from us (`role: "peer"`, `a4af: true`).

`parts` is opt-in because it is one boolean per chunk per peer — a multi-TiB file is 100k+ entries each. It is exactly `part_count` entries, and it describes the file this row is about: the download bitmap for a `source`, the upload bitmap for a `peer`. A peer the core reports as holding every part comes back all-`true`. A pure A4AF row has no bitmap for this file and omits the key. **`parts` never appears in SSE payloads.**

The file's own five-state part view is on [`GET /downloads/{hash}`](#get-apiv0downloadshash); combine it with this bitmap to render the desktop's per-source bar.

Both routes accept `limit` / `offset` / `sort` / `order` exactly as `/clients` does. A partfile with at least one completed chunk is both a download and a shared file, and then **both routes return the same body** — they differ only in which collection the hash must belong to, which is what the `404` checks.

```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/downloads/8b54a3c2…/clients?include_parts=true"
```

**Errors:** `404 not_found` (no download / no shared file with that hash), `400 bad_request` (bad list params, or an `include_parts` that is not a boolean), `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/downloads/{hash}/a4af`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

> `POST` only; a `GET` here answers `405`. A4AF sources are rows of [`GET /downloads/{hash}/clients`](#get-apiv0downloadshashclients--get-apiv0sharedhashclients), carrying the whole peer object rather than a bare ECID, and `a4af_auto` is on the download detail object.

Force A4AF source-swapping for this download. Downloads-only.

**Body:** `{ "action": "<action>", "client_ecid": 1234 }`

| action | Effect |
|---|---|
| `swap_this` | Make other files' A4AF sources take over **this** file. |
| `swap_others` | Release this file's sources to the other files that want them. |

Both move sources one way. A third action, `swap_this_auto`, flipped the `a4af_auto` flag and is gone: a flip cannot be retried safely, and it set a field the download object already reports. Set it with [`PATCH /downloads/{hash}`](#patch-apiv0downloadshash) and `{"a4af_auto": true|false}` instead. Sending `swap_this_auto` here is a `400` naming the replacement.

`client_ecid` is optional and valid **only with `swap_this`**, where it narrows the action from every A4AF source of this file to the single named one — the per-peer "Swap to this file" of the desktop client. It must name a client in the current snapshot that is an A4AF source of *this* download; pairing it with `swap_others` is a `400`, because the core has no per-source form of it.

The swap moves the peer between two files' source lists, so an SSE subscriber sees `download_updated` for **both** the peer's former download and this one, plus `client_updated` for the peer itself.

**Response:** `200 OK` — the post-action A4AF view of this download:

```json
{ "a4af_auto": false, "source_ecids": [ 1234, 5678 ] }
```

`source_ecids` are the ECIDs of the peers holding this file as an A4AF source, joinable against [`GET /api/v0/clients`](#get-apiv0clients). The array is the post-action state, so a `swap_this` naming a single peer shows up as that ECID having left it. The same peers appear as rows with `"a4af": true` on [`GET /api/v0/downloads/{hash}/clients`](#get-apiv0downloadshashclients--get-apiv0sharedhashclients), which carries the whole peer object rather than a bare ECID.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (missing or unknown `action`; `swap_this_auto`, which moved to `PATCH`; a non-integer `client_ecid`; `client_ecid` with the wrong action), `400 amuled_rejected` (the daemon refused the swap — most commonly because the peer is actively sending data, which it will not be swapped away from), `404 not_found` (no download with that hash, or no client with that ECID), `409 conflict` (that client is not an A4AF source of this download), `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/downloads`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Adds one or more ed2k links to the transfer queue.

**Body:**

```json
{ "links": ["ed2k://|file|a|...|/", "ed2k://|file|b|...|/"], "category": 0 }
```

`links` is an array even for one link -- `{"links": ["ed2k://|file|a|...|/"]}` -- and the response is the per-item `results` envelope either way. `category` is optional (defaults to 0).

A singular `ed2k_link` was accepted here previously and is now refused with a `400` naming the replacement.

```sh
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"links":["ed2k://|file|a|...|/", "ed2k://|file|b|...|/"]}' \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/downloads"
```

**Response:** `202 Accepted` (all links accepted — the add is asynchronous: amuled allocates and hashes the partfile before it surfaces in `GET /downloads`, typically within one refresher tick), `207 Multi-Status` (partial), or `503 ec_unavailable` (every link blocked by an EC disconnect). Per-item outcomes use the shared [bulk `results` envelope](#bulk-mutations-and-the-results-envelope), keyed by the submitted link:

```json
{
  "results": [
    { "id": "ed2k://|file|a|...|/", "ok": true },
    { "id": "ed2k://|file|b|...|/", "ok": false,
      "error": { "code": "amuled_rejected", "message": "malformed ed2k link" } }
  ]
}
```

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (malformed body, both forms used, non-string link, link not starting with `ed2k://`), `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `PATCH /api/v0/downloads`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Bulk pause/resume, priority, or category change over multiple downloads — the same patch applied to every listed hash.

**Body:** `{ "hashes": ["<md4>", …], … }` — a non-empty `hashes` array (max 500) plus at least one of the single-item PATCH fields: `status` (`"paused"` | `"resumed"` | `"stopped"`), `priority` (`low` | `normal` | `high` | `auto`), `category` (integer 0–255).

```sh
curl -s -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"hashes":["8b54a3c2…","0a1b2c3d…"],"priority":"high"}' "http://$HOST/api/v0/downloads"
```

**Response:** the [bulk `results` envelope](#bulk-mutations-and-the-results-envelope) (`200` all ok / `207` partial / `503`), keyed by hash. Per-item `error.code` is `not_found`, `amuled_rejected`, or `ec_unavailable`.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (missing/empty `hashes`, no patch field present, invalid field value), `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `DELETE /api/v0/downloads`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Bulk cancel + remove of active downloads (deletes each `.part`/`.met` from disk). A completed entry is rejected per-item with `completed_use_clear_completed` — clear those via `POST /downloads_clear_completed`.

**Body:** `{ "hashes": ["<md4>", …] }` (non-empty, max 500).

**Response:** the [bulk `results` envelope](#bulk-mutations-and-the-results-envelope), keyed by hash. Per-item `error.code` is `not_found`, `completed_use_clear_completed`, `amuled_rejected`, or `ec_unavailable`.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (missing/empty `hashes`), `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `PATCH /api/v0/downloads/{hash}`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Mutates one or more fields of a single partfile. `{hash}` is the 32-char MD4 hex hash (case-insensitive).

**Body:** at least one of:

- `status` — `"paused"`, `"resumed"` or `"stopped"`. `"paused"` halts transfer but keeps the file's sources; `"stopped"` additionally drops all known sources and resets the Kad source search (a stopped file must rediscover sources from scratch on resume); `"resumed"` clears either state. A stopped file reports `status: "stopped"` in the download object (see [`GET /downloads`](#get-apiv0downloads)).
- `priority` — `"low"` / `"normal"` / `"high"` / `"auto"`. Downloads support only these levels and any other value is a `400`; the reason is that the daemon's `.part.met` loader would clamp it back to `normal` on the next restart. (Shared files support the wider `very_low` … `release` set — see [`PATCH /shared/{hash}`](#patch-apiv0sharedhash) and [Priority levels](#priority-levels).)
- `category` — uint8
- `a4af_auto` — bool. Turns automatic A4AF source-swapping on or off for this file. A named value, not a flip: sending `true` twice leaves it `true`. This is the only way to set the flag; the `swap_this_auto` action on [`POST /downloads/{hash}/a4af`](#post-apiv0downloadshasha4af) that used to toggle it is gone, because a toggle cannot survive a retry (see [Idempotency](#idempotency)).
- `comment` + `rating` — set the file's comment (string, ≤ 50 chars) and rating (integer `0`–`5`). Must be sent **together**; only settable when the partfile is also shared (≥ 1 complete chunk), else `409 not_shared`. Primarily a shared-file action — see [`PATCH /shared/{hash}`](#patch-apiv0sharedhash).
- `name` — rename the file (string). Must be non-empty and contain no path separators (`/` or `\`). See the [Takeover flow](#get-apiv0downloadshashfilenames).

```sh
curl -s -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"status":"paused"}' \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/downloads/8b54a3c2..."
```

**Response:** `200 OK` — the updated download object (full detail envelope including `progress.parts`).

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (no recognised field, invalid enum, or `comment`/`rating` sent alone), `409 not_shared` (comment/rating on a non-shared file), `400 amuled_rejected`, `404 not_found`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `DELETE /api/v0/downloads/{hash}`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Cancels an **active** partfile and deletes its on-disk data. `{hash}` is the 32-char MD4 hex hash (case-insensitive). amuled runs `EC_OP_PARTFILE_DELETE` → `CPartFile::Delete()`, which removes the `.part`, `.part.met`, and `.met.bak` files and adds the hash to its `canceledfiles` list (so re-adding the same ed2k link is silently refused until the operator clears that list out-of-band). Completed entries are out of scope; use [`POST /downloads_clear_completed`](#post-apiv0downloads_clear_completed) instead.

```sh
curl -s -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/downloads/8b54a3c2..."
```

**Response:** `204 No Content`.

**Errors:** `400 amuled_rejected`, `404 not_found`, `409 completed_use_clear_completed`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/downloads_clear_completed`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Acks one or more entries in amuled's post-completion notification staging buffer. The on-disk file in the Incoming directory stays in place; this endpoint only clears amuled's "completed transfers awaiting acknowledgement" list. Active partfiles are out of scope; use [`DELETE /api/v0/downloads/{hash}`](#delete-apiv0downloadshash) instead.

Two request shapes share this endpoint:

```sh
# Bulk: no body. Clears every completed entry in one EC roundtrip.
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/downloads_clear_completed"

# Per-entry: clear a single completed entry by hash.
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"hash": "8b54a3c2..."}' \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/downloads_clear_completed"
```

The response envelope is identical for both shapes:

```json
{ "results": [ { "id": "<md4>", "ok": true }, { "id": "<md4>", "ok": true } ] }
```

One entry per cleared hash, in the shared [`results` envelope](#bulk-mutations-and-the-results-envelope). Bulk form returns `200 OK` with an empty `results` array when nothing matches, which is the no-op and stays distinguishable from an amuled rejection (a 4xx with an error envelope). Per-entry form returns `404 not_found` if the hash does not exist and `409 not_completed` if it exists but is not on the completed staging list (an active partfile, where the caller probably wants `DELETE /downloads/{hash}` instead).

**Errors:** `400 amuled_rejected`, `400 bad_request` (malformed body or non-string `hash`), `404 not_found`, `409 not_completed`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

### Clients (peers)

#### `GET /api/v0/clients`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

Lists the peers amuled is currently exchanging with.

**Query parameters:**

- `filter=uploads` — peers we are currently uploading to (`upload_state == "uploading"`).
- `filter=downloads` — peers we are currently downloading from (`download_state == "downloading"`).
- `filter=active` — peers that are either uploading or downloading right now.
- Default (no filter) — every known peer, including queued.

The last five were originally detail-only and were promoted onto this row (and onto the `client_added` / `client_updated` SSE payloads) so a client rendering a peer list does not have to fan out a detail request per row. `part_progress_percent` is `null`, not a sentinel, when the peer is not a source for anything we are downloading — see the detail section below for what all five mean.

`ecid` identifies the remote *peer*, not a file — it's the URL key for [`GET /api/v0/clients/{ecid}`](#get-apiv0clientsecid) and the identity carried in `client_removed` SSE payloads. `user_hash` is the peer's stable identity *when published* (peers without SecIdent or in their first session don't have one), so `ecid` is the always-populated handle.

`upload_file_hash` / `download_file_hash` are the 32-char MD4 hex hashes of the partfile or shared file the peer is currently transferring with — directly resolvable against [`/api/v0/downloads/{hash}`](#get-apiv0downloadshash) (in-progress) or the corresponding entry in [`/api/v0/shared`](#get-apiv0shared) by `.hash`. Either field can be empty when the peer is queued / idle in that direction. `download_file_name` is the filename the peer advertised in `OP_REQFILENAMEANSWER` and is populated only while we're actively downloading from them. `upload_file_name` is the partfile the peer is downloading **from us**, resolved locally against our own partfile list — present only while we're uploading to them.

`software` and `software_version` are locale-independent, per the API's English-only contract. `software` is one of the tokens in the enumerated-fields table below; `software_version` is a free-form string. A peer the daemon could not identify reports `"software": "unknown"` and `"software_version": "unknown"` — a lowercase sentinel, never a daemon-localized string (the daemon's own version formatting is gettext-translated and is deliberately not surfaced here). `os_info` is the peer's *own* self-reported OS string (raw external data, not normalized by amuled) and is frequently empty, since most clients don't send it.

`ident_state` is the peer's secure-identification (SecIdent) state, one of `"not_available"` (the peer does not support SecIdent, or this build has no crypto), `"id_needed"` (its public key is known but the signature exchange has not completed), `"identified"` (verified), `"id_failed"` (signature verification failed), `"bad_guy"` (verified earlier, but currently connecting from a *different* IP than the one it was verified on) or `"unknown"` (state not yet reported for a newly seen peer). `"bad_guy"` is also briefly reported for a legitimate peer that reconnected after an IP change and has not re-identified yet, so treat it as a hint rather than a verdict.

**Enumerated string fields.** Every peer field below carries one of a fixed set of lowercase, locale-independent tokens — the daemon decodes amuled's internal enums server-side so consumers never need the lookup tables. The complete sets:

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| `upload_state` | `uploading`, `queued`, `waitcallback`, `connecting`, `pending`, `lowtolowip`, `banned`, `error`, `idle`, `unknown` |
| `download_state` | `downloading`, `onqueue`, `connected`, `connecting`, `waitcallback`, `waitcallbackkad`, `reqhashset`, `noneededparts`, `toomanyconns`, `toomanyconnskad`, `lowtolowip`, `banned`, `error`, `idle`, `remotequeuefull`, `unknown` |
| `ident_state` | `not_available`, `id_needed`, `identified`, `id_failed`, `bad_guy`, `unknown` |
| `obfuscation_status` | `undefined`, `enabled`, `supported`, `not_supported`, `disabled`, `unknown` |
| `software` | `emule`, `cdonkey`, `lxmule`, `amule`, `shareaza`, `emule_plus`, `hydranode`, `mldonkey`, `lphant`, `edonkey_hybrid`, `edonkey`, `old_emule`, `compat`, `unknown` |
| `source_origin` | `server`, `kad`, `source_exchange`, `passive`, `link`, `source_seeds`, `search_result`, `unknown` |

Every one of them falls back to `"unknown"` for a code the daemon does not map, so a client can treat `"unknown"` as its default branch and never has to handle an absent or unexpected token. Note the two distinct sentinels on `obfuscation_status`: `"undefined"` is *the peer has not told us yet*, `"unknown"` is *the daemon received a code it does not recognise*. The authoritative mappings are the `Client*Name()` / `SourceOriginName()` functions in `src/webapi/Refresher.cpp`.

`country_code` is the peer's ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (lowercase, e.g. `"de"`), resolved server-side from the peer IP by the daemon's GeoIP database. It is an empty string when GeoIP is disabled or unsupported by the build, or when the IP does not resolve — render the flag and localized country name client-side from the code. The flag image is served by [`GET /flags/{code}.png`](#get-flagscodepng); the localized name has no endpoint because the browser already has it (`Intl.DisplayNames` with `{ type: "region" }`).

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (unknown filter token), `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `GET /api/v0/clients/{ecid}`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

Returns the full detail object for a single peer — every field [`GET /clients`](#get-apiv0clients) returns for that peer, **plus** the detail-only fields below. `{ecid}` is the peer's `ecid` (the EC connection id). Bare object, no list envelope.

`ecid`, not `user_hash`, is the resource key: not every peer has a hash (unidentified / some LowID / eDonkey peers expose an empty one), a hash is not unique among a peer's simultaneous connections, and it is unauthenticated unless the peer uses Secure Identification. `ecid` is always present and unique per live connection. Trade-off: `ecid` is reassigned when amuled restarts, so a detail URL is **not** stable across restarts — use the `user_hash` field for a durable reference.

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/clients/4382"
```

```json
{
  "ecid": 4382,

  "is_friend": false,
  "dl_up_modifier": 1.0,
  "part_progress_percent": 87.5
}
```

The detail fields mirror the desktop "Client Details" modal. Five of the fields below — `source_origin`, `available_parts`, `mod_version`, `view_shared_disabled` and `part_progress_percent` — are **not** detail-only: they are on the [`GET /clients`](#get-apiv0clients) row and the SSE payload too, and are described here because this is where the rest of their neighbours live. `user_id_hybrid` is the peer's hybrid eD2k id; `high_id` is `true` for a HighID peer (id ≥ `16777216`, i.e. `0x1000000`) and `false` for LowID — the same threshold and the same spelling as `ed2k.high_id` on [`GET /status`](#get-apiv0status), so the value means the same thing on both ends of the API. `server_ip` / `server_port` / `server_name` describe the eD2k server the peer connects through (`server_ip` is `""` when unknown). `kad_port` is non-zero when the peer is reachable on Kad. `source_origin` is how the peer was discovered (values in the enumerated-fields table under [`GET /clients`](#get-apiv0clients)). (`upload_file_name` is part of the base field set — see [`GET /clients`](#get-apiv0clients) above.) `available_parts` is the count of parts the peer holds of the linked file, or `null` when the peer has not reported a part map (see [Unknown values](#unknown-values)); `mod_version` is the peer's client-mod string (often `""`); `view_shared_disabled` is `true` when the peer forbids browsing its shared files. `is_friend` is `true` when the peer is in your friends list (`CUpDownClient::IsFriend()`) — **distinct** from `friend_slot`, which is a *reserved upload slot* granted to a peer and can be set for non-friends. `dl_up_modifier` is the upload score modifier the GUI labels "DL/UP modifier" (`GetScoreRatio()`). `part_progress_percent` is the peer's completeness of the file we are downloading **from** them (`available_parts` over that file's part count) and is `null` when there is no linked download or the part count is unknown (see [Unknown values](#unknown-values)).

> `is_friend` and `dl_up_modifier` ride two EC tags added for this endpoint. A webapi built against a newer core talking to an **older** amuled that doesn't send them degrades gracefully — `is_friend` reads `false` and `dl_up_modifier` reads `0`.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (`{ecid}` is not a non-negative integer), `404 not_found` (no peer with that ecid in the current snapshot), `405 method_not_allowed` (non-GET), `503 ec_unavailable`.

---

#### `POST /api/v0/clients/{ecid}/shared_files`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Browse a peer's shared file list — the API equivalent of "View Files" in the GUI. `{ecid}` is the peer's `ecid`. amuled opens (or reuses) a direct client-to-client connection to that peer and asks it to enumerate its shared directories and files.

The browse runs **asynchronously**: the peer answers over the network, one directory at a time, and a HighID/reachable peer may take seconds while a LowID peer needs a server callback or Kad first. So this endpoint does **not** return the files — it returns a `search_id` and the results flow through the **search machinery**, exactly like a query search:

- `GET /api/v0/search/{id}/results` reads the accumulated files as they arrive (standard search-result fields, plus `directory` — the folder each file sits in inside the peer's share). The browse also appears in [`GET /api/v0/search`](#get-apiv0search) with `kind: "browse"` and the browsed peer's `client_ecid`.
- The refresher advances `search_progress` for this `search_id` while the browse is live, and emits a `search_finished` SSE event when the peer's list is complete or the browse fails (denied / peer unreachable / connection lost). A denied or failed browse finishes with zero results — there is no distinct error event.

Reusing the search id-space means one poll loop and one SSE stream cover both queries and browses; a client tells them apart by remembering which `search_id` it started with which verb.

```sh
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/clients/4382/shared_files"
```

**Response:** `202 Accepted`, with a `Location: /api/v0/search/{search_id}` header and the browse as the body -- the same row [`GET /search`](#get-apiv0search) lists, with `kind: "browse"` and `query` holding the peer's name:

```json
{
  "search_id":   17,
  "query":       "some peer",
  "kind":        "browse",
  "state":       "running",
  "client_ecid": 4382,
  "started_at":  1750412400
}
```

A browse the daemon cannot even start — a LowID peer it has no way to call back, for instance — is reported as `finished` immediately rather than left pending: no connection is attempted, so there is nothing to wait for. It carries no results, the same as a browse the peer denied.

**Idempotent while a browse is running.** Asking again for a peer that is already being browsed returns **the same `search_id`** rather than starting a second browse — amuled will not re-ask a peer that is still answering, so a second id would name a browse that never happens. Two clicks therefore leave one browse, one id and one entry on [`GET /api/v0/search`](#get-apiv0search). Once that browse has settled, a fresh request starts a new one with a new id.

Status `202 Accepted` — the browse was started, not completed. Then poll:

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/search/17/results"
```

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (`{ecid}` is not a non-negative integer), `403 forbidden` (guest token — browsing is `ADMIN`-only), `404 not_found` (no peer with that ecid), `405 method_not_allowed` (non-POST), `502 bad_gateway` (core accepted the request but returned no `search_id`), `503 ec_unavailable`.

---

### Known clients

#### `GET /api/v0/known_clients`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

Lists every peer the daemon has ever exchanged data with, from its credit store.

Distinct from [`GET /clients`](#get-apiv0clients), which lists the peers connected **right now**. The two differ in identity as well as content: a live client is keyed by `ecid`, which is meaningful only within one daemon process, while a known client is keyed by `user_hash` and survives daemon restarts. Correlate the two on `user_hash`; the `online` field says whether a given record has a live counterpart at this moment.

Standard [list envelope](#list-pagination-and-sorting) under the `known_clients` key, with `limit` / `offset` / `sort` / `order`.

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/known_clients?sort=last_seen&order=desc&limit=2"
```

```json
{
  "known_clients": [
    {
      "user_hash": "a1b2c3d4e5060e708090a0b0c0d06f00",
      "name": "example-peer",
      "ip": "192.0.2.10",
      "port": 4665,
      "kad_port": 4675,
      "country_code": "de",
      "software": "amule",
      "version": "v2.3.1",
      "source_origin": "kad",
      "obfuscation": "supported",
      "total_uploaded": 0,
      "total_downloaded": 0,
      "last_seen": 1786652714,
      "first_seen": 1786652714,
      "sessions": 1,
      "online": false
    }
  ],
  "total": 392, "offset": 0, "limit": 2
}
```

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `user_hash` | 32-char lowercase MD4. The identity; join with `/clients`. |
| `name` | Peer-chosen name. Absent when never recorded. |
| `ip`, `port`, `kad_port` | Last address the peer was seen at. Absent together. |
| `country_code` | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, lowercase, resolved by the daemon's GeoIP. Absent when GeoIP is off or the address does not resolve. Artwork: [`GET /flags/{code}.png`](#get-flagscodepng). |
| `software`, `version` | Same tokens `GET /clients` uses. Absent together. |
| `source_origin` | How the peer was first found — `server`, `kad`, `source_exchange`, `passive`, … |
| `obfuscation` | Protocol-obfuscation state as of the last session. |
| `total_uploaded`, `total_downloaded` | Lifetime bytes, from the credit record. Always present. |
| `last_seen` | Unix seconds. Always present. For a peer that is connected this is *now* — it is being seen — so the connected records are the most recent in the store under `sort=last_seen&order=desc`. A peer that left during the current tick carries the same timestamp and ties with them; ties keep a stable order across requests. |
| `first_seen`, `sessions` | Present together, and only for a record the daemon holds metadata for. |
| `online` | Whether this peer is connected right now, correlated by `user_hash`. |

**Optional fields are omitted, never emitted empty.** A record written before the daemon kept per-peer metadata carries only the hash, the totals and `last_seen`; the rest are absent so a consumer can tell "never recorded" from "recorded as empty". On a long-lived node most records are of that kind.

The store is read from the daemon **once**, on the first request, and maintained from there: every refresher tick folds the connected peers back in, so later requests never touch EC at all. That is sound rather than a shortcut — a record whose peer is not connected cannot change, since credit totals only move during a transfer and `last_seen` is written at disconnect. What the maintenance covers:

- a peer that connects is added, with `first_seen` and `sessions` set to what the daemon recorded when it said hello;
- a connected peer's `online`, `total_uploaded` and `total_downloaded` track the live client state;
- a bare record gains its name, address, software and origin once its peer identifies;
- a connected peer's `last_seen` is now, and a peer that leaves has `online` cleared with `last_seen` stamped at the moment it went.

The cost is one EC roundtrip per amuleapi process, and the store stays resident from first use.

**Errors:** `405 method_not_allowed` (non-GET/HEAD), `503 ec_unavailable`, `503 ec_unsupported` (the connected amuled predates the client-history request — it is never sent to a daemon that does not advertise support).

---

### Shared files

#### `GET /api/v0/shared`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

Lists every file the local node is sharing. The `complete_sources` counter is amuled's estimate of how many peers in the swarm hold the file complete.

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://$HOST/api/v0/shared"
```

```json
{
  "shared": [
    {
      "hash":             "1a2b3c4d...",
      "name":             "release-notes.txt",
      "ed2k_link":        "ed2k://|file|release-notes.txt|3217|1a2b...|/",
      "size":             3217,
      "priority":         "normal",
      "priority_auto":    false,
      "complete_sources": 12,
      "xfer":     { "session": 5242880,  "total": 314572800 },
      "requests": { "session": 42,       "total": 1837 },
      "accepts":  { "session": 18,       "total": 921 },
      "upload_speed_bps": 51200,
      "uploading":        2,
      "last_upload":      1700000500,
      "shared_since":     1699000000,
      "hashing_progress": 0,
      "media": {
        "length_s": 212,
        "bitrate":  320,
        "codec":    "mp3",
        "artist":   "Some Artist",
        "album":    "Some Album",
        "title":    "Some Title"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`xfer.session` / `xfer.total` are bytes uploaded during the current amuled process vs over the file's lifetime. `requests` counts how many peers have asked for the file; `accepts` counts how many of those requests were granted an upload slot. The `session` counters reset on amuled restart; `total` is persisted in `known.met`.

`upload_speed_bps` is the file's current combined upload rate in bytes/sec (summed over the peers it is uploading to), and `uploading` is how many peers it is actively uploading to right now — together the "is this file being seeded" signal, the upload-side analogue of the `/downloads` speed + transferring-source counts. Subtract `uploading` from the queued-client count (`queued_count`, on the detail view) to show `uploading / queued`. Both are live and refresh every tick. `last_upload` is the unix timestamp of the last time data was sent for the file, and `shared_since` is when the file was completed or first shared; both are persisted in `known.met` and are `null` when unknown: a file that has never uploaded, or a `known.met` entry written before these fields existed.

`priority` is the upload priority — `"very_low"` / `"low"` / `"normal"` / `"high"` / `"release"` — and `priority_auto` is `true` when amuled is deriving that level automatically from the upload queue. This mirrors the `/downloads` shape (base `priority` + separate `priority_auto` flag); on an auto file `priority` reports the current derived level, not the literal string `"auto"`. For a file that is both downloading and shared this upload priority is independent of the download priority reported by [`GET /api/v0/downloads`](#get-apiv0downloads).

`hashing_progress` is the number of parts hashed so far by a pass running over the file — a [`POST /shared/{hash}/verify`](#post-apiv0sharedhashverify) run, or an AICH hashset rebuild — and `0` when nothing is hashing. It is a count of completed parts, not the index of the part in flight, so it runs `0` → `part_count` (see the detail endpoint, or compute `ceil(size / 9728000)`).

A file that is both downloading and shared reports its progress here as well: amuled describes such a file as a partfile, so the value is read across from the download side and the two agree. That makes `hashing_progress` usable from either list without checking which one owns the file.

`media` is present only on an audio or video file that has been probed, and absent entirely otherwise — check for the key rather than for empty values. Its six fields are the same ones the detail endpoint reports, and a [media refresh](#post-apiv0sharedmediarefresh) replaces all of them, clearing any the new probe no longer finds.

The SSE `shared_added` / `shared_updated` event payload matches this object byte-for-byte, so a subscriber that received `shared_updated` does not need to re-GET to see the moved counters — including `media`, which is what makes a metadata refresh observable without polling.

**Errors:** `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `GET /api/v0/shared/{hash}`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

Detail view for a single shared file. `{hash}` is the 32-char MD4 hex hash (case-insensitive). Returns every field of the [`GET /shared`](#get-apiv0shared) list item plus the detail-only fields below — one call for everything about a shared file. The list endpoint is unchanged.

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/shared/8b54a3c20fae9e4b9f7e0c2c8c01b6b1"
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `file_type` | string | Category token derived from the extension, lowercased: `"audio"`, `"videos"`, `"archives"`, `"cd-images"`, `"pictures"`, `"texts"`, `"programs"`, or `"any"` for unknown. |
| `share_ratio` | number | `xfer.total / size`; `0` when `size == 0`. |
| `path` | string | Directory path of the on-disk file — the temp directory while the file is still an incomplete partfile, the destination directory once it has completed. Identical to `path` on `/downloads/{hash}` for the same file. |
| `incomplete` | bool | `true` while the file is still an incomplete partfile, `false` once complete. Always present. A download that has finished but has not been cleared yet reports `false`, since its data already sits in the destination directory. |
| `complete_sources_range` | object | `{ "low": int, "high": int }` — the estimated full-copy source range behind the scalar `complete_sources`. |
| `aich_hash` | string | AICH master hash (hex); `""` if not yet computed. |
| `part_count` | int | Total parts, `ceil(size / 9.28 MiB)`. |
| `parts` | array | Per-part source availability, `[{ "sources": int }, ...]`, exactly `part_count` entries in file order. **Omitted entirely** until the first decode has landed, so "no data yet" and "no sources for any part" stay distinguishable. See below. |
| `queued_count` | int | Clients waiting on this file's upload queue. |
| `comment` | string | The user's own comment on this file (`""` if none). |
| `rating` | int | The user's own rating, `0`–`5` (`0` = unrated). |
| `media` | object | Audio/video metadata — see [Media metadata](#media-metadata). **Omitted entirely** when the file has no probed metadata. |

`hashing_progress` comes through from the list item; pair it with `part_count` here for a percentage.

`parts[].sources` is how many peers currently requesting this file hold that part — an **availability** measure, not a progress one. A shared file is fully local by definition, so a part with `"sources": 0` means no other peer has it and you are its only source. Counts saturate at `255`.

This is deliberately detail-only. A 100 GB file has ~10 800 parts, so carrying the array on [`GET /shared`](#get-apiv0shared) or in `shared_updated` SSE events would multiply that across the whole share on every tick — the same reason `progress.parts` is absent from the downloads list. `shared_updated` events are unaffected by source-count changes.

For a shared file that is also still downloading, the same values are available as `progress.parts[].sources` on [`GET /downloads/{hash}`](#get-apiv0downloadshash); both come from one encoder in amuled, so they agree.

**Errors:** `404 not_found` (no shared file with that hash), `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `GET /api/v0/shared/{hash}/content`

**Auth:** `GUEST` — `HEAD` is accepted too; any other method is `405 method_not_allowed` with `Allow: GET, HEAD`.

Downloads the bytes of a completed shared file. `{hash}` is the 32-char MD4 hex hash (case-insensitive), the same one [`GET /shared`](#get-apiv0shared) reports. This is the only route that serves library content: everything else on the surface describes files, this one hands them over.

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/shared/8b54a3c20fae9e4b9f7e0c2c8c01b6b1/content" -o file.bin
```

**Response headers** on a `200` or `206`:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `Content-Type` | `application/octet-stream`, always |
| `Content-Disposition` | `attachment; filename="<name>"; filename*=UTF-8''<name>` |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | `default-src 'none'; sandbox` |
| `Accept-Ranges` | `bytes` |
| `ETag` | `"<mtime>-<size>"`, hex, set by this handler rather than hashed from the body |
| `Content-Length` | the exact number of bytes the response carries |
| `Content-Range` | on a `206` and a `416` only |

**Never `inline`, never the file's real media type.** A completed download lands in Incoming, which is itself shared, so both the bytes and the filename came from strangers on the ed2k network — and amuleapi serves the Web UI from this same origin. A shared `evil.html`, or a scripted `.svg`, returned under its "real" type would execute against the user's own session. `octet-stream` + `attachment` + `nosniff` + a sandbox CSP are four independent reasons the browser will not run it. The filename is sanitised for the quoted form and percent-encoded for the extended one, so a name carrying quotes or control characters cannot forge further parameters or split the header.

**Ranges.** A single byte range is served as `206 Partial Content` with a `Content-Range`; `bytes=0-9` and the suffix form `bytes=-100` both work. A range that starts at or past EOF is `416 range_not_satisfiable` with `Content-Range: bytes */<size>`, so the client learns the true length without a second request.

Everything else is **ignored** rather than refused, and answered `200` with the full body — an unrecognised range unit (per RFC 9110 §14.2), a value too large for a 64-bit offset (rejected, never wrapped), and, deliberately, a **multi-range** request. RFC 7233 §3.1 permits a server to ignore `Range`, and never emitting `multipart/byteranges` is what makes the CVE-2011-3192 "Apache Killer" amplification shape a no-op here: a request naming hundreds of overlapping windows costs exactly one linear read of the file, the same as no `Range` header at all. `If-Range` is likewise ignored; a client that sends one gets the `Range` honoured as though the header were absent, which is live bytes rather than a silently stitched mix of two versions.

**Conditional GET.** The `ETag` is `mtime-size` rather than a hash of the body — hashing a multi-gigabyte file per request would not be a slow path but an unusable one. `If-None-Match` is answered here rather than by the generic stamping described in [ETag and conditional GET](#etag-and-conditional-get), and accepts `*`, a comma-separated list, and weak `W/"..."` validators. A match is `304 Not Modified` with no content and the `ETag` preserved. It is evaluated **before** `Range`, per RFC 9110 §13.2.2, so a conditional request that also carries a `Range` answers `304`, never `206`. The validator carries no `-gzip` suffix because a file response is never compressed: there is exactly one representation to name, and `Accept-Encoding` cannot produce a `Content-Encoding` on this route.

**Concurrency.** The transport caps concurrent file responses at 6, because each one pins a file descriptor and a streaming buffer for as long as the peer takes to drain it. Over the cap the answer is `503 file_responses_exhausted` with a `Retry-After`, the same shape the SSE session cap uses — an honest refusal rather than a queue that grows without bound. Within the cap the body streams through a fixed 64 KiB buffer and is never held in memory, so a multi-gigabyte transfer moves the daemon's RSS by kilobytes.

**Same-host only.** The bytes are read from the filesystem **amuleapi** is running on, not amuled's. The two are usually the same machine, but the EC endpoint is configurable, so amuleapi can be pointed at a remote amuled — and then the daemon's paths mean nothing here. The desktop remote GUI carries a whole path-mapping layer for exactly this split; amuleapi has no equivalent, and does not guess. A path that resolves to nothing is `503 ec_content_unreachable`; a path that resolves to a *different* file that merely shares a name is caught by the size invariant and is `503 ec_content_mismatch` rather than being served under the wrong hash. Both say the deployment is misconfigured, not that the request was wrong. On a split deployment, download through amuled instead.

**Errors:** `401 unauthorized` (no token), `404 not_found` (no shared file with that hash — and every path-resolution refusal, collapsed into the same reply so it cannot be used to probe the share layout), `405 method_not_allowed`, `409 partfile_unsupported`, `416 range_not_satisfiable`, `503 path_unavailable`, `503 ec_content_unreachable`, `503 ec_content_mismatch`, `503 file_responses_exhausted`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

Only completed files can be downloaded. A file still downloading is rejected with `409 partfile_unsupported`: a partfile's on-disk layout is gapped and its offsets do not correspond to the completed file's, so a byte range taken out of it would be silently **wrong** rather than merely unavailable.

`503 path_unavailable` carries `Retry-After: 5` and is transient rather than an error in the request. The file's directory rides an EC tag amuled emits only on the frames where it changed, so a snapshot taken before the first such frame knows the file but not where it lives. The resource exists; it just cannot be addressed yet.

#### `POST /api/v0/shared_reload`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Equivalent to the desktop client's "Reload" button — amuled re-walks its shared directories and updates the file list.

```sh
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/shared_reload"
```

Returns `202 Accepted`. amuled schedules the re-walk and answers immediately, so the response confirms only that the reload was **scheduled** — it never carries the outcome. The walk begins on amuled's next processing tick, within about a second, and a large or network-mounted share tree can take minutes to finish.

Repeated calls coalesce: requesting a reload while one is already pending, or while a walk is in progress, results in a single further walk rather than one per call.

**Reading the result.** The walk brackets itself with two amule log lines, so read them back from [`GET /api/v0/logs/amule`](#get-apiv0logsamule) or the `logs` SSE channel. Both are localised and the second is pluralised, so a client matching on them should pin the daemon's locale:

- `Reloading shared files...` when the walk starts
- `Found 1234 known shared files` when it ends

The resulting changes also arrive as `shared_added` / `shared_removed` events on the `shared` SSE channel, which is the better signal if you only care about the delta.

**Errors:** `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/shared/media/refresh`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Re-extract media metadata for every shared file, whether or not it already has some.

```sh
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/shared/media/refresh"
```

```json
{ "scope": "all", "queued": 812 }
```

Returns `202 Accepted`. `queued` is how many files were **accepted for probing**, not how many produced metadata — files the scheduler drops (not audio/video by extension, an incomplete download, missing on disk) are not counted, and nothing has been extracted yet when the response returns.

This is the only way to correct metadata that is *wrong* rather than missing. The normal scheduler skips any file that already carries a media tag, so a value stored by an older build — a cover-art codec, or a preview inherited from a search result before the local probe could overwrite it — is otherwise permanent short of deleting `known.met`, which would also discard the ed2k part hashes and every per-file statistic.

A refresh also retries files a previous probe could not read. amuled records that ffprobe already ran on a file and found nothing usable, so a broken or truncated one is not re-probed on every share reload and every restart; that record is what a refresh clears. Repair the file, or install a working ffprobe, and ask for a refresh -- there is no need to touch `known.met`.

Each probe **replaces** every media field, including *clearing* one the new probe no longer finds, so a refresh corrects a value in both directions. Nothing else about a file is touched: statistics, comment, rating, upload priority, AICH hash set and share state all survive, the file is not re-hashed, its ed2k hash does not change, and it never leaves the share.

The work runs on amuled's media-probe worker, one file at a time, so downloads and uploads are unaffected and the daemon stays responsive. Shutting down mid-refresh is clean — files not yet reached keep their previous values. Progress is observable through [`GET /api/v0/logs/amule`](#get-apiv0logsamule) and, as each probe lands, `shared_updated` SSE events.

Cost is roughly 13 ms per file — a probe reads the container header, not the file — so a 10 000-file library is on the order of two minutes of background work.

**Errors:** `400 amuled_rejected` (media metadata extraction is disabled in amuled's preferences), `503 ec_unsupported` (the connected amuled predates this operation), `503 ec_unavailable`.

`queued: 0` means the share held no eligible file, which is a legitimate answer for a share with no audio or video in it. It is no longer how a disabled feature reports itself: that is a `400`, so the two cannot be confused.

#### `POST /api/v0/shared/{hash}/media/refresh`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

The same operation for a single file, which is the quickest way to check a fix on one file rather than a whole library.

```json
{ "scope": "file", "queued": 1 }
```

**Errors:** `404 not_found` (no shared file with that hash), `409 partfile_unsupported` (an incomplete download has no complete file to read), `400 amuled_rejected` (media metadata extraction is disabled, or the file is not eligible: not audio/video, or an incomplete download), `503 ec_unsupported`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `GET /api/v0/share_directories`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

The share roots amuled is configured with — as opposed to [`GET /shared`](#get-apiv0shared), which lists the files those roots produced. This is the *intent*: a recursive root is one entry here however many subdirectories it covers.

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/share_directories"
```

```json
{
  "directories": [
    { "path": "/home/user/media", "recursive": true },
    { "path": "/home/user/iso", "recursive": false }
  ]
}
```

`recursive` distinguishes the two lists amuled keeps (`shareddir-recursive.dat` vs `shareddir-explicit.dat`). The runtime union it derives from them — every expanded subdirectory — is deliberately not exposed: it is generated state, not configuration.

**Errors:** `502 amuled_rejected`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `PUT /api/v0/share_directories`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Replace the whole set of roots. A full replace rather than a merge, because that is exactly what amuled's operation does — making it a `PUT` keeps the semantics honest instead of hiding a read-modify-write.

```sh
curl -s -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"directories":[{"path":"/home/user/media","recursive":true}]}' \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/share_directories"
```

```json
{ "results": [ { "id": "/srv/share", "ok": true } ] }
```

`recursive` is optional and defaults to `false`.

amuled validates every path: a REST client cannot stat the core's filesystem, so a typo would otherwise become a silently dead share. Paths that pass are applied and persisted before the response returns, and every submitted path gets an entry either way, so **one bad entry does not discard the edit** and a caller can tell an applied path from one the response simply did not mention. A response with any rejection is `207 Multi-Status`, as with every other multi-item mutation:

```json
{
  "results": [
    { "id": "/srv/share", "ok": true },
    { "id": "/typo", "ok": false, "code": "not_found", "message": "no such directory" }
  ]
}
```

`reason` is `not_found` (missing, or not a directory) or `not_readable`. amuled reports these as codes and the API renders them, so its locale never leaks into your response.

The **rescan is scheduled, not completed**, before the response returns: a successful reply means the new roots are validated and persisted, and that the re-walk will start on amuled's next processing tick. Until it finishes, [`GET /api/v0/shared`](#get-apiv0shared) still serves the previous file list. Observe completion the same way as [`POST /api/v0/shared_reload`](#post-apiv0shared_reload), whose notes on log lines and coalescing apply here too.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (`directories` not an array, an entry without a non-empty `path`, non-boolean `recursive`), `502 amuled_rejected`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/share_directories`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Add a single root, leaving the others alone — the convenience path for scripts that would otherwise have to read the list, splice it and write it back.

```sh
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"path":"/home/user/new","recursive":true}' \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/share_directories"
```

Idempotent: adding a path that is already configured updates its `recursive` flag rather than failing, so "ensure this folder is shared" is safe to repeat. Same `{ok, rejected}` body as `PUT`.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (missing/empty `path`, non-boolean `recursive`), `502 amuled_rejected`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `DELETE /api/v0/share_directories`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Remove a single root. The path is a query parameter rather than a path segment because it is an absolute filesystem path.

Pass the **exact** `path` string returned by `GET /share_directories`, percent-encoded — the match is byte-for-byte, so a differing separator or drive-letter case will not match. This is what makes Windows roots work: percent-encoding carries the backslashes, the `C:` colon, and any spaces through unchanged.

```sh
# POSIX root: /home/user/new
curl -s -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/share_directories?path=%2Fhome%2Fuser%2Fnew"

# Windows root: C:\Users\bob\My Shares
curl -s -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/share_directories?path=C%3A%5CUsers%5Cbob%5CMy%20Shares"
```

Removing a path that is not configured is a `404` rather than a silent success, so a typo — or a path that does not byte-match what `GET` returned — is visible. Same `{ok, rejected}` body as `PUT`.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (no `path` parameter), `404 not_found` (path not configured), `502 amuled_rejected`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

> Concurrency: `POST` and `DELETE` are read-modify-write against amuled's whole-list operation, serialised inside amuleapi so two API clients cannot lose each other's change. Nothing can make them atomic against a *simultaneous* edit from amuleGUI — the protocol has no compare-and-set — so that case is last-write-wins.

#### `POST /api/v0/shared/{hash}/verify`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Equivalent to the desktop client's "Verify Local Data" — amuled re-hashes the file's on-disk data against the MD4 (and, where a hashset is available, AICH) hashes it has stored, reporting any blocks that no longer match.

```sh
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/shared/$HASH/verify"
```

Returns `202 Accepted`, with no body. amuled queues the hashing task and answers immediately, so the response confirms only that the re-hash was **scheduled** — it never carries the outcome, and a large file may take minutes to finish.

**Watching it run.** While the task is hashing, `hashing_progress` on the file's [`GET /shared`](#get-apiv0shared) row counts the parts done so far, and each advance pushes a `shared_updated` SSE event — enough to drive a progress bar without polling. It returns to `0` when the task finishes or aborts, which is the signal that the log line below is available.

**Reading the result.** The verdict is emitted as an amule log line when the task completes, so read it back from [`GET /api/v0/logs/amule`](#get-apiv0logsamule) or the `logs` SSE channel:

- `Verify Local Data (MD4 & AICH): Result OK for <path>`
- `Verify Local Data (MD4 & AICH): ERRORS FOUND! <path> Failed blocks: MD4: 3,7 AICH: 5: (0,2)`

Like all daemon log output these lines are gettext-translated at the daemon's locale and carry no correlation id tying them to a specific request, so treat them as human-readable output rather than a machine-parseable contract.

**Errors:** `404 not_found` (no shared file with that hash), `409 partfile_unsupported`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

Only completed files can be verified. A file still downloading is rejected with `409 partfile_unsupported`: the hashing task skips partfiles outright, so accepting one would promise a report that never arrives. A download that has *finished* but is still listed under `/downloads` is a valid target.

#### `PATCH /api/v0/shared`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Bulk upload-priority change over multiple shared files — the same `priority` applied to every listed hash.

**Body:** `{ "hashes": ["<md4>", …], "priority": "<level>" }` — a non-empty `hashes` array (max 500) plus a required `priority` (`very_low` | `low` | `normal` | `high` | `release` | `auto`).

**Response:** the [bulk `results` envelope](#bulk-mutations-and-the-results-envelope) (`200` all ok / `207` partial / `503`), keyed by hash. Per-item `error.code` is `not_found`, `amuled_rejected`, or `ec_unavailable`.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (missing/empty `hashes`, missing/invalid `priority`), `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `PATCH /api/v0/shared/{hash}`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Changes the upload priority and/or the comment+rating of a single shared file. `{hash}` is the 32-char MD4 hex hash (case-insensitive). The body must include at least one of `priority` or the `comment`+`rating` pair.

**Body:**

```json
{
  "priority": "very_low" | "low" | "normal" | "high" | "release" | "auto",
  "comment":  "<string, ≤ 50 chars>",
  "rating":   0
}
```

Send a bare priority level to pin it (the file's `priority_auto` becomes `false`). Send `"auto"` to hand level selection to amuled — it derives the level from the upload queue, and `GET /api/v0/shared` then reports the derived base `priority` with `priority_auto: true`. The combined `"*_auto"` strings are not accepted as input, since `"auto"` is the level the daemon computes rather than one the caller pins.

`comment` and `rating` must be sent **together** (both or neither) — the daemon writes them as one atomic operation. `comment` is capped at 50 characters; `rating` is an integer `0`–`5`. Setting them requires the file to be shared. The same fields are accepted on [`PATCH /downloads/{hash}`](#patch-apiv0downloadshash) for a downloading file that is also shared.

`name` renames the file — a non-empty string with no path separators (`/` or `\`, rejected to prevent the rename escaping the file's directory). Rename works on any known file, so it is accepted on both this endpoint and [`PATCH /downloads/{hash}`](#patch-apiv0downloadshash).

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (missing/invalid fields, `comment`/`rating` sent alone, or a `name` that is empty or contains a path separator), `409 not_shared` (comment/rating on a non-shared file), `400 amuled_rejected`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

### Servers (ed2k server list)

#### `GET /api/v0/servers`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "ecid": 1,
      "name": "eMule Server",
      "description": "Public server",
      "version": "17.15",
      "address": "203.0.113.5:4242",
      "country_code": "de",
      "port": 4242,
      "users": 312000,
      "max_users": 500000,
      "files": 75000000,
      "soft_file_limit": 1000,
      "hard_file_limit": 5000,
      "priority": "normal",
      "ping_ms": 42,
      "failed_count": 0,
      "static": false,
      "tcp_flags": {
        "bitmask": 1497,
        "compression": true,
        "new_tags": true,
        "unicode": true,
        "related_search": true,
        "type_tag_integer": true,
        "large_files": true,
        "tcp_obfuscation": true
      },
      "udp_flags": {
        "bitmask": 1851,
        "get_sources": true,
        "get_files": true,
        "new_tags": true,
        "unicode": true,
        "get_sources_v2": true,
        "large_files": true,
        "udp_obfuscation": true,
        "tcp_obfuscation": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`country_code` is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (lowercase, e.g. `"de"`) of the server host, resolved server-side from the server IP by the daemon's GeoIP database — same semantics and empty-string fallback as the peer `country_code` on `/clients`, and the same artwork route, [`GET /flags/{code}.png`](#get-flagscodepng).

`files` is how many files the server indexes. `soft_file_limit` and `hard_file_limit` are something else entirely: the per-user publishing limits the server advertises. Below the soft limit a client may publish every file it shares, between soft and hard only its rarest, above the hard limit nothing. Both arrive only once the server has answered a UDP status request, so **`0` means "not reported yet", not "the limit is zero"** — render it blank rather than as a number, the way the desktop's Soft Files / Hard Files columns do. `users`, `max_users` and `files` share that sentinel.

`failed_count` is the number of consecutive failed connection attempts, not a boolean.

`tcp_flags` and `udp_flags` are the eD2k wire capabilities the server announced, decoded server-side so a consumer never needs the protocol tables. Every key below is always present — `false` when the bit is clear — so there is no need to branch on key existence. `bitmask` carries the raw value alongside, both for diagnostics and so a bit a newer server announces that this build does not name yet is still visible. A server that has announced nothing yet reports `bitmask: 0` with every boolean `false`.

`tcp_flags`:

| Key | Bit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `compression` | `0x0001` | zlib-compressed packets |
| `new_tags` | `0x0008` | compact tag encoding |
| `unicode` | `0x0010` | Unicode strings |
| `related_search` | `0x0040` | related-files search — whether a `related::<hash>` local search will work against this server |
| `type_tag_integer` | `0x0080` | integer file-type tags |
| `large_files` | `0x0100` | files larger than 4 GiB |
| `tcp_obfuscation` | `0x0400` | TCP protocol obfuscation |

`udp_flags`:

| Key | Bit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `get_sources` | `0x0001` | extended GetSources request |
| `get_files` | `0x0002` | extended GetFiles request |
| `new_tags` | `0x0008` | compact tag encoding |
| `unicode` | `0x0010` | Unicode strings |
| `get_sources_v2` | `0x0020` | GetSources v2 |
| `large_files` | `0x0100` | files larger than 4 GiB |
| `udp_obfuscation` | `0x0200` | UDP obfuscation |
| `tcp_obfuscation` | `0x0400` | TCP obfuscation, announced over UDP |

Both objects spell out the transport on their obfuscation keys because `udp_flags` legitimately carries both bits; a key means exactly one wire capability in either object.

**Errors:** `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/servers`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Add a server to amuled's known-server list.

**Body:**

```json
{ "address": "203.0.113.5:4242", "name": "eMule Server" }
```

`name` optional; `address` required and must parse as `host:port`.

**Response:** `202 Accepted`, no body. `EC_OP_SERVER_ADD` answers success or failure and never returns the server it made, so anything reported here would be a reconstruction from the snapshot after an inline refresh -- a guess that can silently come back short. Re-read [`GET /servers`](#get-apiv0servers) for the new entry.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request`, `400 amuled_rejected`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/servers/{ecid}/connect` / `POST /api/v0/servers/by-address/{address}/connect`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Tells amuled to disconnect from its current server and dial the specified one. Two route shapes are equivalent — `{address}` is `<ip>:<port>`, and the address form looks up the ECID by exact `(ip, port)` match against the server cache before delegating to the ECID handler. It has its own `by-address` path rather than being sniffed out of `{ecid}`, so nothing about the URL is ambiguous. Hostname-form addresses do NOT resolve here — pass the literal IP.

```sh
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/servers/by-address/203.0.113.5:4242/connect"
```

**Response:** `202 Accepted`, no body. The connect is asynchronous; its outcome shows up on [`GET /status`](#get-apiv0status)'s `ed2k.state` and on the SSE stream.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (unparseable address/ECID), `404 not_found`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `DELETE /api/v0/servers/{ecid}` / `DELETE /api/v0/servers/by-address/{address}`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Removes the server from amuled's list.

**Response:** `204 No Content`.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (`{ecid}` is not a non-negative integer, or `{address}` is not a dotted quad with a port in 1–65535), `400 amuled_rejected`, `404 not_found` (well-formed but no such server), `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `PATCH /api/v0/servers/{ecid}` / `PATCH /api/v0/servers/by-address/{address}`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Sets an ed2k server's priority, its static flag, or both — the same operation the desktop server list offers from its context menu.

**Body:** both fields are optional, and only the ones present are applied; a body with neither is a `400`.

```json
{ "priority": "high", "static": true }
```

`priority` is one of `"low"` / `"normal"` / `"high"` — the same values `GET /servers` reports. `static` marks the server as one amuled keeps across list updates.

```sh
curl -s -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"priority":"high","static":true}' \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/servers/1"
```

**Response:** `200 OK` → the full server object as it now stands, the same shape [`GET /servers`](#get-apiv0servers) lists. A `PATCH` answers with the state the caller just produced, so no re-read is needed to see it.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (unknown `priority`, non-bool `static`, or neither field present), `400 amuled_rejected`, `404 not_found`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/servers_update`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Tells amuled to fetch the `server.met` from the supplied URL and refresh its list. Same operation the desktop GUI's "Update server list from URL" button drives.

**Body:**

```json
{ "servers_url": "http://example.com/server.met" }
```

The URL must start with `http://` or `https://`; anything else is rejected `400 bad_request`.

The URL is **persisted** into the `servers.update_url` preference, so a subsequent `GET /preferences` reflects it — there is no need to PATCH it separately.

**Response:** `202 Accepted`, no body. The URL came from the request (or, when omitted, from the preference this documents), and the download runs asynchronously -- its outcome arrives on the log channel.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request`, `400 amuled_rejected`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

The friends list amuled persists to `emfriends.met`. The daemon ships the whole list inside the update every client already receives, so `GET /friends` costs no roundtrip of its own.

`{ecid}` is the friend's own id, distinct from the peer ECIDs on `/clients`. Like every ECID it does **not** survive an `amuled` restart — use `user_hash` as the durable reference where a friend has one. A friend added by address alone has no hash.

#### `GET /api/v0/friends`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

```json
{
  "friends": [
    {
      "ecid": 12,
      "name": "alice",
      "user_hash": "a1b2c3d4e5060e708090a0b0c0d06f00",
      "ip": "203.0.113.42",
      "port": 4662,
      "client_ecid": 4382,
      "online": true,
      "friend_slot": false
    }
  ],
  "total": 7,
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 7
}
```

`client_ecid` is the live peer this friend is currently linked to, joinable against [`GET /api/v0/clients`](#get-apiv0clients), and `0` when the friend is offline — `online` is the convenience form of that test. `user_hash` is `""` for a friend added by address only, and `ip` is `""` for a zero address.

`friend_slot` reads `false` against a daemon predating the tag that carries it, the same way `is_friend` and `dl_up_modifier` degrade on `/clients`.

**Errors:** `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/friends`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Two mutually exclusive body forms.

Promote a connected peer:

```json
{ "client_ecid": 4382 }
```

Or add by address, where `ip` and `port` are required and non-zero, `user_hash` must be 32 hexadecimal characters when given, and `name` defaults to the address:

```json
{ "ip": "203.0.113.42", "port": 4662, "name": "alice", "user_hash": "a1b2c3d4e5060e708090a0b0c0d06f00" }
```

Sending `client_ecid` together with any address field is a `400`.

**Response:** `202 Accepted`, no body. EC's `FRIEND` op answers success or failure and never returns the record it created, so the only way to name the new friend here was to diff the snapshot against a pre-add copy and hope the inline refresh had already surfaced it. Re-read [`GET /friends`](#get-apiv0friends), keyed on the address or hash the request carried.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request`, `404 not_found` (no connected client with that `client_ecid`), `400 amuled_rejected`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `DELETE /api/v0/friends/{ecid}`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

**Response:** `204 No Content`.

Removing the friend that currently holds the friend slot clears it.

**Errors:** `404 not_found`, `400 amuled_rejected`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `PATCH /api/v0/friends/{ecid}`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

**Body:** `{ "friend_slot": true }` — the only mutable field.

**Response:** `200 OK` → the updated friend object.

Only one friend can hold the slot at a time, so granting it clears it on whoever held it before. A single call therefore changes two records and emits two `friend_updated` events; the response body describes only the friend named in the URL.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request`, `404 not_found`, `400 amuled_rejected`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/friends/{ecid}/shared_files`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Browse a friend's shared files. The friend-addressed twin of [`POST /api/v0/clients/{ecid}/shared_files`](#post-apiv0clientsecidshared_files), and more capable: a friend record carries a stored address, so the daemon can browse a friend who is **not currently connected**, which the clients route cannot do.

**Response:** `202 Accepted`, with a `Location` header and the browse row as the body, exactly as on the clients route. Poll [`GET /api/v0/search/{id}/results`](#get-apiv0searchidresults) with the `search_id` it carries. Idempotent while a browse of that peer is running, exactly as on the clients route.

**Errors:** `403 forbidden`, `404 not_found`, `502 amuled_rejected`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

### Categories

amuled's category system lets users tag downloads with one of N user-defined buckets (separate save directory, separate priority, separate color). Category 0 is the default "Uncategorized" and cannot be deleted.

#### `GET /api/v0/categories`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "name": "All",
      "path": "/home/user/aMule/Incoming",
      "comment": "",
      "color": 0,
      "priority": "normal"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 1
}
```

A list endpoint like the others: `?limit`, `?offset`, `?sort` and `?order` apply, and the `total` / `offset` / `limit` trio describes the window. See [List pagination and sorting](#list-pagination-and-sorting); the sort keys are `index` and `name`.

Category `0` is always present, so the list is never empty. amuled's EC omits the row entirely until the first custom category exists, so amuleapi synthesises it when missing:

```json
{ "index": 0, "name": "Default", "path": "/home/user/aMule/Incoming", "comment": "", "color": 0, "priority": "low" }
```

`name` and `path` are filled in for index `0` whether the row came from the daemon or was synthesised here. amuled holds neither -- its `defaultcat` is built with an empty title and path -- so a client rendering a category picker was left with a blank row it had to label itself, and nothing to show for where an uncategorised download lands. `path` is `directories.incoming` from [`GET /preferences`](#get-apiv0preferences), which is genuinely where such a file is saved. `priority` is `low`, amuled's own default for the row.

Filling both in unconditionally is deliberate: doing it only for the synthesised row would mean `/categories/0` answered `"Default"` on a daemon with no custom categories and `""` as soon as the operator added one, which is a response shape that depends on unrelated state.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (bad list params), `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/categories`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

**Body:**

```json
{
  "name": "Linux ISOs",
  "path": "/home/user/aMule/Incoming/Linux",
  "comment": "Distros only",
  "color": 16711680,
  "priority": "high"
}
```

`name` required; others optional. `color` is a 24-bit RGB integer. `priority` is applied to the category's member files as a download priority, so it takes the same restricted set as [`PATCH /downloads`](#patch-apiv0downloads) — `"low"` / `"normal"` / `"high"` / `"auto"`. `very_low` and `release` are rejected (the daemon would clamp them to `normal` on the next restart).

**Response:** `202 Accepted`, no body. `EC_OP_CREATE_CATEGORY` answers success or failure and never returns the index it assigned, so naming the new category here meant scanning the snapshot for one with a matching name and falling back to a bodiless `201` when the scan came up short. Re-read [`GET /categories`](#get-apiv0categories) for the assigned index.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request`, `400 amuled_rejected`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `GET /api/v0/categories/{index}`

**Auth:** `GUEST`, matching the collection read.

Returns the single category object, the same shape [`PATCH`](#patch-apiv0categoriesindex) returns. Every other resource with a member path has a member `GET`; this one did not, so a client that had just created a category and wanted the stored result had to re-fetch the whole collection and search it by index.

`{index}` is a uint8. A non-numeric or out-of-range segment is `400 bad_request`; an index no category holds is `404 not_found`. Index `0` is always present, synthesised when amuled omits it and carrying the same `name` / `path` fill-in, exactly as on the collection: the two routes cannot disagree about which categories exist or about what they hold.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request`, `404 not_found`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `PATCH /api/v0/categories/{index}`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Any subset of the POST body fields. `index 0` (the default category) can be patched but not deleted.

#### `DELETE /api/v0/categories/{index}`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

**Response:** `204 No Content`.

Deleting `index 0` is rejected by amuled (`400 amuled_rejected`).

---

### Preferences

#### `GET /api/v0/preferences`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

Returns every preference category amuled carries over EC. The `general` and `connection` sub-objects are the original common-case set; the remaining categories map 1:1 to the daemon's own settings and mirror the desktop "Preferences" tabs.

```

Booleans are plain JSON `true`/`false` regardless of how amuled encodes them on the wire. **Passwords are never returned** — the webserver admin/guest and amuleapi passwords are write-only (see PATCH). `general.user_hash` is the node's own identity hash, not a password.

`connection.extended_udp_port_enabled` is positive-sense: `true` means the extended UDP port (Kad / global search) is on. `security.shared_files_visibility` is a 3-state enum string, not a bool: `"everybody"` / `"friends"` / `"nobody"`.

`ip2country` is the GeoIP (IP-to-country) config category. `supported` is a capability flag: `false` when the connected daemon is built without GeoIP — the config fields are then present but inert. `source` is one of `"dbip"` / `"maxmind"` / `"custom"` (the next-download database selector). `maxmind_license` is returned plainly (it is a config string the daemon already round-trips, not a masked password). `loaded_source`, `db_path`, `db_loaded`, `download_in_progress`, and `last_update_result` are **read-only** live status (the currently loaded DB and any in-flight refresh); they are ignored if sent on PATCH.

`files.media_metadata_enabled` / `files.ffprobe_path` control media-metadata extraction: when enabled, the daemon probes shared audio/video with `ffprobe` to advertise length, bitrate, codec, artist, album and title. `ffprobe_path` is a **daemon-side** path — an empty string means the daemon auto-detects the binary, trying `ffprobe` on its `PATH` and then a per-platform list of well-known install locations. The detected path is deliberately **not** written back: it describes the daemon's machine rather than a choice you made, so `ffprobe_path` keeps reading as `""` while extraction works, and a daemon that moves to a host with ffmpeg somewhere else re-detects on its own. Set the field explicitly to pin one binary and override detection. When nothing is found the daemon logs one line saying so — visible on [`GET /api/v0/logs/amule`](#get-apiv0logsamule) — and extraction stays inert until ffmpeg is installed or the path is set. `connection.bind_address` (empty = bind to any local IP), `connection.bind_interface` (a daemon-side interface name such as `eth0` / `en0` / `tun0`; empty = any), and `online_signature.directory` are likewise daemon-side paths/addresses. These, together with `files.start_next_alphabetical`, `security.reject_spoofed_source_ips`, `security.use_system_ipfilter`, and `online_signature.update_frequency_seconds`, are ordinary daemon settings; a `bind_address` change takes effect on the next amuled restart.

`files.mmap_supported` is **read-only** — the daemon advertises whether it was built with memory-mapped file I/O (`false` on a core without mmap support, e.g. Windows or a build with `-DENABLE_MMAP=OFF`); it is ignored if sent on PATCH. `files.mmap_enabled` is the runtime toggle for memory-mapped block I/O — download writes to part files, upload reads of both shared (completed) and partial files, and hashing (lower per-process memory use, at some write-path cost; best for upload-heavy or memory-constrained hosts). It is **capability-gated**: a PATCH that sets `files.mmap_enabled` is rejected with **409 `conflict`** when `files.mmap_supported` is `false`, so the option is only writable against a daemon that can actually use it. Safe to toggle with active transfers.

`connection.upnp_enabled` toggles UPnP router forwarding of the daemon's P2P ports — the ports themselves are `connection.tcp_port` (ed2k TCP) and `connection.udp_port` (ed2k/Kad UDP). `connection.upnp_tcp_port` is a separate optional knob: the fixed local port the UPnP control point (libupnp) binds to for the router's callbacks, `0` meaning auto-assign — **not** a forwarded port. `connection.upnp_available` is **read-only** — the daemon advertises whether it was built with UPnP (`false` on a core built `-DENABLE_UPNP=OFF`, where `upnp_enabled` has no effect); it is ignored if sent on PATCH. (Web-server and EC-port UPnP are intentionally not exposed — amuleweb is deprecated and the EC port is not a P2P port.)

The `connection.proxy_*` fields configure the proxy the **daemon** routes its P2P and HTTP traffic through. `proxy_type` is one of `"socks5"` / `"socks4"` / `"http"` / `"socks4a"` — any other value is a `400`. It is the empty string when the daemon has no proxy type configured at all (the core's `PROXY_NONE`), a state that cannot be set back through this API; use `proxy_enabled: false` to turn the proxy off. `proxy_auth` toggles username/password authentication. `proxy_password` is **write-only** — accepted on PATCH but never returned on GET (same as the `remote_controls` passwords); PATCH the other proxy fields without it to leave the stored password unchanged.

**Errors:** `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `PATCH /api/v0/preferences`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

**Not every field in the `GET` is writable.** The payload mixes four kinds, and the response does not mark them, so this is the list:

| Kind | What `PATCH` does | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Settable | applied | most of the 125 -- `files.mmap_enabled`, `connection.max_connections`, … |
| Read-only status | ignored, request still succeeds | `files.mmap_supported`, `connection.upnp_available`, the six `ip2country.*` |
| Write-only | applied, never echoed on `GET` | `remote_controls.webserver.password`, `.guest_password` |
| Refused | `400 bad_request` | `remote_controls.amuleapi.password`, `.guest_password`, `.guest_enabled` |

Read-only fields are **ignored rather than rejected** when they arrive alongside at least one writable field, so the obvious way to use this endpoint -- `GET` the object, change one value, `PATCH` the whole thing back -- keeps working. A body naming *only* read-only fields is a `400` that says which ones: `no writable fields in the request; files.mmap_supported is read-only`.

Body shape mirrors the GET; every sub-object and every field is optional, and fields not present are left unchanged. Subset example:

```json
{ "files": { "add_new_downloads_paused": true }, "servers": { "dead_server_retries": 5 } }
```

`remote_controls` nests its two independent subsystems as `remote_controls.webserver` and `remote_controls.amuleapi` rather than prefixing every field. It reports amuleapi's `enabled` / `port` / `bind_address`, but **not** whether its admin or guest password is set. Those live in `amuleapi-passwords`, which amuleapi owns and which may sit on a different host from amuled — so the daemon's view of that file can be the wrong one. Ask the API that actually reads it: [`GET /auth/passwords`](#get-apiv0authpasswords), which is admin-only, whereas this endpoint is readable by any authenticated role. `webserver.guest_enabled` is reported because it is a genuine amuled preference rather than a fact about another process's file.

**Write-only passwords** (accepted here, never echoed on GET) live under `remote_controls.webserver`: `password`, `guest_password`. Send the plaintext — amuled stores the hash. `guest_password` requires that guest access be enabled (pass `guest_enabled: true` in the same request, or leave it already enabled).

amuleapi's own `admin` and `guest` passwords are **not** settable here; `remote_controls.amuleapi.password`, `.guest_password` and `.guest_enabled` are rejected with `400 bad_request`. Use [`PATCH /auth/passwords`](#patch-apiv0authpasswords), which writes the credential file this daemon actually reads, requires the current password, and is rate-limited. A field here would instead travel over EC to whichever aMule this amuleapi is attached to and land in that host's config directory.

**`ip2country`** accepts `enabled`, `source` (`"dbip"` / `"maxmind"` / `"custom"` — any other value is a `400`), `custom_url`, `maxmind_license`, and `auto_update`. It also accepts a **write-only** `update_now` boolean that triggers an immediate database download from the (just-applied) source; it is never echoed on GET. `supported` and the read-only status fields (`loaded_source`, `db_path`, `db_loaded`, `download_in_progress`, `last_update_result`) are ignored if sent.

> **Note:** these are the daemon's live settings — the same ones the desktop GUI edits. Some are self-affecting: changing `remote_controls.amuleapi.port` / `.bind_address`, or `directories.incoming` / `temp`, alters the very daemon you are talking to. A port/bind change only takes effect on the next amuled restart, so it will not drop your current connection mid-request.

**Response:** `200 OK` — full preferences object (post-mutation), so a read-modify-write client can confirm what landed without a follow-up GET.

**Numeric fields are bounded to what the daemon can actually hold**, not to the width of their JSON type. A value outside the range is a `400` naming the range; it is never accepted and quietly changed. Several of these bounds are much narrower than they look, because the core stores the setting differently from how the API spells it:

| Field | Range | Step | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `connection.tcp_port` | `1`–`65532` | | the server UDP socket is TCP+3, and the core substitutes the default port for anything higher |
| `core_tweaks.file_buffer_bytes` | `0`–`3825000` | `15000` | stored as a `uint8` count of 15000-byte blocks |
| `core_tweaks.max_upload_queue_clients` | `0`–`25500` | `100` | stored as a `uint8` count of hundreds |
| `core_tweaks.max_new_connections_per_5s` | `0`–`65535` | | stored as a `uint16` |
| `core_tweaks.kad_max_source_searches` | `5`–`50` | | clamped to this range at daemon start |
| `core_tweaks.kad_reask_minutes` | `30`–`60` | | clamped to this range at daemon start |
| `core_tweaks.source_reask_minutes` | `15`–`60` | | clamped to this range at daemon start; below it the UDP reask gets you auto-banned for reask spam |

The two fields with a **step** accept only whole multiples of it: `file_buffer_bytes: 20000` is a `400`, not a silent round down to `15000`. The names stay in the unit you think in rather than being renamed to the daemon's internal one, and the price is that the API is strict about the values in between.

The three **clamped at daemon start** rows are the reason this is enforced on the write rather than left to the client to check. Their setters assign the value raw, so a `GET` right after the `PATCH` reports it back faithfully and only the next restart reveals that the daemon never kept it.

**A low `connection.max_upload_kbps` caps `max_download_kbps`,** which is the one place a `PATCH` changes a field the request did not name. Below `4` kB/s up the download limit is forced to 3× the upload; below `10` it is forced to 4×. So `PATCH {"connection": {"max_upload_kbps": 3}}` also sets `max_download_kbps` to `9`. This is a deliberate anti-leech rule in the core rather than a defect, it applies whichever of the two you write, and the `PATCH` response echoes the whole preferences object so the adjusted value is visible in the reply.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (unknown/mis-typed field, or a body with no recognized fields), `400 amuled_rejected`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

### Network control

These endpoints drive amuled's connect/disconnect to the ed2k network, the Kad network, or both.

#### `POST /api/v0/networks/connect`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

**Body:** `{ "network": "ed2k" | "kad" | "both" }` (optional; defaults to `"both"`). Same shape as `/networks/disconnect` — `"ed2k"` fires `EC_OP_SERVER_CONNECT`, `"kad"` fires `EC_OP_KAD_START`, omitted/`"both"` fires `EC_OP_CONNECT`.

**Response:** `202 Accepted`.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (unknown selector), `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/networks/disconnect`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

**Body:** `{ "network": "ed2k" | "kad" | "both" }` (optional; defaults to `"both"`).

**Response:** `200 OK`.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

> Dedicated `POST /api/v0/kad/connect` and `POST /api/v0/kad/disconnect` shortcuts existed in an earlier draft of v0 but were dropped in favour of the `/networks/{connect,disconnect}` body selector — `{"network":"kad"}` does exactly what they did. The `/kad/bootstrap` endpoint below is genuinely distinct and stays.

#### `POST /api/v0/kad/bootstrap`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Manual Kad bootstrap against a single known-good Kad node. Fires `EC_OP_KAD_BOOTSTRAP_FROM_IP` against amuled. This is the only Kad bootstrap surface the EC protocol exposes — `nodes.dat` is read by amuled at startup from its own data directory and is NOT manageable via REST.

**Body:** `{ "ip": "203.0.113.5", "port": <uint16> }`. `ip` is a dotted-quad string, per the [IP addresses](#ip-addresses) rule; the conversion to the integer EC carries happens inside amuleapi. `port` is the contact's UDP port. A `uint32` was accepted here too and is now a `400`: the two spellings disagreed about byte order, so the same address reached the daemon differently depending on how it was written.

```sh
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"ip":"203.0.113.5","port":4672}' \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/kad/bootstrap"
```

**Response:** `202 Accepted` → `{ "ip": "1.2.3.4", "port": 4672 }`. The Kad probe itself is fire-and-forget UDP; the `202` confirms amuled accepted the request, not that the contact was reachable.

The echo is the documented exception to the no-body rule for actions: it reports **which address the daemon parsed**, which the caller cannot read back anywhere else. `ip` comes back as a dotted quad whichever form the request used -- answering with the host-order integer meant a client that posted `"1.2.3.4"` and stored the reply held `16909060`, a value no other field on this surface produces and one it could not post back without converting.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (missing `ip`, or an `ip` that is not a string — a numeric one included, missing/non-numeric `port`, port outside `[0, 65535]`, malformed dotted-quad), `400 amuled_rejected`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/kad/update`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Downloads a `nodes.dat` from the supplied URL and rebuilds the Kad node list from it — the Kad counterpart of [`POST /api/v0/servers_update`](#post-apiv0servers_update), and the same operation the desktop GUI's "Update node list from URL" button drives.

**Body:**

```json
{ "nodes_url": "https://upd.emule-security.org/nodes.dat" }
```

```sh
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"nodes_url":"https://upd.emule-security.org/nodes.dat"}' \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/kad/update"
```

Two side effects are worth planning for. The URL is **persisted** into the `kademlia.update_url` preference, so a subsequent `GET /preferences` reflects it — there is no need to PATCH it separately. And once the download completes, amuled **stops Kad, swaps in the new `nodes.dat`, and starts Kad again**; expect a brief Kad outage and a `kad_state` transition on the SSE stream. The desktop GUI prompts before doing this; the API does not.

**Response:** `202 Accepted`, no body. The URL came from the request, and the download is asynchronous -- the `202` confirms amuled accepted the request, not that the node list was replaced, and its outcome arrives on the log channel.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (missing/non-string/empty `nodes_url`, or a scheme other than `http://` / `https://`), `400 amuled_rejected`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `GET /api/v0/kad`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

Standalone view of the Kad subtree from `/status`, plus the detail fields the status rollup omits (`node_id`, `firewalled_udp`, `lan_mode`, your `public_ip`, the `indexed` Kad-store counters, and `buddy` contact info for low-ID peers). Together with `GET /api/v0/preferences` (for the TCP/UDP port numbers the firewalled messages quote) this covers every row of the desktop client's **Networks → Kad Info** panel.

```json
{
  "state": "connected",
  "node_id": "8f3a1c07d94b2e5a6018bb4c7f209d3e",
  "firewalled_tcp": false,
  "firewalled_udp": false,
  "lan_mode": false,
  "connected_since": 1751000000,
  "public_ip": "203.0.113.5",
  "network": { "users": 5400000, "files": 1400000000, "nodes": 2400 },
  "indexed": { "sources": 12000, "keywords": 8500, "notes": 0, "load": 14 },
  "buddy": { "status": "connected", "ip": "203.0.113.9", "port": 4672 }
}
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `state` | string | `disabled` / `connecting` / `connected`. `disabled` means Kad is not running at all, which is the condition several fields below key their "no measurement" value on. The same value `GET /api/v0/status` reports as `kad.state`. |
| `node_id` | string | This node's own 128-bit Kademlia id, 32 lowercase hex characters (the desktop panel shows the same value uppercase). `""` while Kad is not running, which is exactly when `state` is `disabled`. Persisted by the daemon, so unlike the session-scoped ECIDs and the server-assigned eD2k id it is stable across restarts — the one identifier for the local node a consumer can key on. It is a DHT routing key, not a credential: every Kad contact the daemon talks to learns it. |
| `connected_since` | int | Unix seconds of the most recent Kad connect, the same value `GET /api/v0/status` reports as `kad.connected_since`. `0` when not connected, so gate on `state` rather than trusting a `0`. |
| `public_ip` | string | This node's externally-visible IPv4, as a remote Kad contact reported it back. Two "not known" cases, both matching what the desktop panel's *IP address* row shows: `""` while Kad is not connected (the daemon sends the field only then), and `0.0.0.0` while connected but not yet told its own address by any contact. **Two distinct "unknown" sentinels, one of them a syntactically valid address**: a consumer that only checks for `""` will treat `0.0.0.0` as a real IP. Distinct from `preferences.connection.bind_address`, which is the local interface the daemon binds to. Named `public_ip` rather than `ip` because `buddy.ip` in the same payload belongs to somebody else. |
| `firewalled_tcp` | bool | Whether this node is firewalled for **TCP**. The verdict is a **vote**: two distinct peers must confirm reachability by opening an incoming TCP connection carrying `OP_KAD_FWTCPCHECK_ACK` before it clears to `false`. With no verdict yet it defaults to **`true`**, which is the conservative reading: assume firewalled until proven otherwise. During an IP recheck it freezes at its previous value rather than momentarily reporting a false LowID. Named for the transport because it is one half of a pair, not an overall verdict that `firewalled_udp` refines. |
| `firewalled_udp` | bool | Whether this node is firewalled for **UDP**, measured by an entirely different mechanism: a directed test with its own state, which can also declare firewalled **by timeout** after six minutes. amuled sends this only while Kad is connected, so it reads **`false` whenever Kad is down**. That is the absence of a measurement, *not* "UDP is open". Note the asymmetry with `firewalled_tcp`, which defaults the other way: a consumer reading both while Kad is disconnected sees `true` / `false` and neither value means anything. This is the most likely field on the payload to be misread. |
| `lan_mode` | bool | `true` when the daemon is running Kad in LAN mode. It **forces both firewalled fields to `false`** regardless of any measurement, which is why it belongs beside them: a `false` on either flag is only meaningful once you have checked this one. |
| `network.users` / `.files` / `.nodes` | int | Network-wide estimates for the whole Kad network, not counts belonging to this node. Unlike everything else in this payload they are **not** gated on Kad being connected, so they can be non-zero while `state` is `disabled`. The same values `GET /api/v0/status` reports under `kad.network`. |
| `indexed.sources` / `.keywords` / `.notes` | int | Kad-store counters: how many entries this node is holding for the network as a DHT participant. Sent only while connected, so all three read `0` while Kad is down. |
| `indexed.load` | int | A **load figure, not a count**, despite sitting beside three counts: it is the Kad store's fill level. Sent only while connected, so it reads `0` while Kad is down. |
| `buddy.status` | string | LowID-buddy state for NAT-traversal peers: `no_buddy` / `connecting` / `connected` (`unknown` only if the daemon ever ships a value outside its own enum). Reads `no_buddy` while Kad is not connected — the daemon sends the field only while connected, and that absence is what both the core and the desktop client treat as *no buddy*. `buddy.ip` / `buddy.port` are only meaningful under `connected`: they are `0.0.0.0` / `0` while connected with no buddy, and `""` / `0` while Kad is down. |

### IP filter

The IP-filter *settings* are ordinary preferences (`security.ipfilter_*` on [`GET`/`PATCH /api/v0/preferences`](#get-apiv0preferences)). The two endpoints here are the standalone operations behind the desktop client's Security page buttons: reloading the filter files amuled already has on disk, and downloading a new one.

Neither reports its outcome in the response — amuled answers both immediately and does the work asynchronously. What actually happened shows up only in the amule log, readable through [`GET /api/v0/logs/amule`](#get-apiv0logsamule) or the `logs` SSE channel. The lines to watch for:

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Loading IP filters 'ipfilter.dat' and 'ipfilter_static.dat'.` | a reload started |
| `IP filter is ready` | the new filter is live |
| `Successfully updated ipfilter.dat` | the download landed and a reload follows |
| `Failed to download ipfilter.dat from <url>` | the download failed; the old filter stays live |

Those lines are gettext-translated at the daemon's locale and carry no correlation id, so treat them as human-readable output, not a machine-parseable contract.

#### `POST /api/v0/ipfilter/reload`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Re-reads `ipfilter.dat` and `ipfilter_static.dat` from amuled's configuration directory into the live filter — the desktop client's "Reload List" button. Use it after dropping a filter file into that directory by hand. No body.

amuled keeps the current filter live until the new one has finished loading, so this is accepted, never completed.

```sh
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/ipfilter/reload"
```

**Response:** `202 Accepted`. The body carries whatever status string amuled returned for the reload -- for this opcode, none, so it is an empty object.

**Errors:** `400 amuled_rejected`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/ipfilter/update`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Downloads an `ipfilter.dat` from a URL, swaps it in and reloads — the desktop client's "Update now" button.

**Body (optional):**

```json
{ "ipfilter_url": "http://upd.emule-security.org/ipfilter.zip" }
```

`ipfilter_url` must start with `http://` or `https://` when given. Omit it and the configured `security.ipfilter_update_url` is used instead; if that is empty too the request is rejected `400 bad_request` rather than accepted and silently dropped. The configured value is read from amuleapi's preferences snapshot, which trails amuled by up to one refresh tick — a `PATCH /preferences` immediately followed by a bodyless update can still send the previous URL, so pass `ipfilter_url` explicitly when it matters which one runs.

```sh
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"ipfilter_url":"http://upd.emule-security.org/ipfilter.zip"}' \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/ipfilter/update"
```

An explicit URL is **persisted** into the `security.ipfilter_update_url` preference, so a subsequent `GET /preferences` reflects it and the next startup auto-update (`security.ipfilter_auto_update`) uses it — the same side effect [`POST /api/v0/servers_update`](#post-apiv0servers_update) and [`POST /api/v0/kad/update`](#post-apiv0kadupdate) have.

**Response:** `202 Accepted`, no body. Where the request named a URL it already knows which one ran; where it omitted one, `security.ipfilter_update_url` on [`GET /preferences`](#get-apiv0preferences) is the answer, and the paragraph above is why reading it there is the honest version -- the snapshot this handler resolves from is the same one that endpoint serves.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (non-string / empty / non-`http(s)` `ipfilter_url`, or no URL available at all), `400 amuled_rejected`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

---

### Logs

#### `GET /api/v0/logs/amule`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

amuled's general log buffer.

**Query parameters:** `tail=N` — return only the last N lines (default: full buffer).

```json
{
  "lines": ["2026-06-19 11:00:00: line one", "...line two"],
  "total_cached": 1024,
  "returned": 2
}
```

`lines` is the array of log lines; `total_cached` is how many lines are held in the buffer and `returned` how many this response carried (≤ `tail`).

#### `DELETE /api/v0/logs/amule`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Clears the buffer.

**Response:** `204 No Content`, with no body -- a pure action with nothing to report.

#### `GET /api/v0/logs/serverinfo` / `DELETE /api/v0/logs/serverinfo`

**Auth:** `GUEST` / `ADMIN`

The ed2k server-info log buffer. Unlike `/logs/amule`, amuled ships this one as a single accumulated text blob, so the GET returns a `text` **string** rather than a `lines` array. `?tail=N` still selects by trailing lines (it walks back N newline boundaries), but the byte counts in the response describe the result.

```json
{
  "text": "Connecting to eMule Server (203.0.113.5:4242)\nConnection established\n",
  "total_bytes": 4096,
  "returned_bytes": 68
}
```

`DELETE /api/v0/logs/serverinfo` clears the buffer and answers `204 No Content` with no body.

---

### Statistics

#### `GET /api/v0/stats/tree`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

**Query parameters:** `max_client_versions=N` (`0`–`255`, default `0` = unlimited) — caps how many per-software **version** rows the daemon serializes. Only the version lists are affected; the OS breakdown and the fixed skeleton nodes are always complete. A long-lived node accumulates hundreds of version rows, so a dashboard showing a top-10 should pass this rather than discard the rest client-side.

A tree mirroring amuled's "Statistics" tree (transfers, connections, clients, servers, downloads). Cached with a 1 s TTL.

The envelope is `{ "nodes": [...] }`. Each node is `{ "key": "<id>", "label_value": "<value>", "label": "<template>", "values": [...], "children": [...] }`. A leaf is a node whose `children` array is empty. `key` and `label_value` are optional (see below).

`label` is the **untranslated English template** (e.g. `"Total uploaded: %s"`), and `values` are the **typed, raw** values that fill its `%s` placeholders in order — the client formats and localizes them. This keeps the response identical regardless of the amuleapi/amuled `--locale` (see [Response model](#response-model)). A container node (one that only groups children) has an empty `values` array.

`key` is a **stable, machine-readable identifier** for the node (e.g. `"upload_data"`, `"ul_dl_ratio"`, `"servers_working"`). Unlike `label`, it does not change when the label is reworded, and it is never translated — use it to locate a specific field instead of matching on the label string. The `key` is optional: it is present only for nodes the daemon assigns one to, and it is omitted entirely when absent (older daemons that predate this field emit no `key` at all). Keys are unique among the fixed skeleton nodes; the dynamic per-client-software rows share a key by kind (see below).

`label_value` is the **raw, untranslated machine value** for nodes whose `label` is itself data — the per-client-software breakdown rows, where the label is a version or OS string (`"v0.70b: %s"`, `"Linux: %s"`). It carries just that value (`"v0.70b"`, `"Linux"`) so a client reads it directly instead of parsing it out of the `label`. Present only on those rows; omitted otherwise and on daemons that predate the field. These rows are grouped under the `client_versions` / `client_operating_system` container nodes and each row carries `key: "client_version"` / `key: "client_os"` — so the `key` tells you the kind and `label_value` gives the value.

Each value is `{ "type": "<type>", "value": <raw> }`:

| `type` | `value` JSON | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `integer` | number | plain count |
| `bytes` | number | raw bytes |
| `speed` | number | raw bytes/second |
| `time` | number | raw seconds |
| `double` | number | raw double |
| `string` | string | opaque English string (e.g. a ratio, or `"Not available"`) |

A `string` value that is a **well-known sentinel** additionally carries a `token` field with a stable, locale-independent token — currently `"never"` (a "Never" timestamp, e.g. max-connection-limit-reached) and `"not_available"` (a ratio with no data yet). The English `value` is left in place unchanged, so this is purely additive: prefer `token` when present and fall back to `value` otherwise. It is absent on non-sentinel values and on daemons that predate the field.

A value may carry a nested `extra` value of the same shape — whatever the desktop prints in parentheses. It is **three different quantities** depending on the node, so format it from its own `type` rather than assuming: a **percentage of the parent** on counter nodes that show one, a **packet count** beside a byte total on the packet nodes, and the **all-time total** beside a session figure on the transfer counters.

The UL:DL ratio node (`key: "ul_dl_ratio"`) additionally carries a `ratio` object with numeric `session` and `total` fields, so clients don't have to parse its composite string value. Both are **download-per-upload** doubles (received ÷ sent bytes): `session` for the current session, `total` for all time. Each field appears only when the daemon can compute it (both sides greater than zero); the whole `ratio` object is omitted when neither is available and on daemons that predate this field. No other node type carries `ratio`.

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "key": "transfer",
      "label": "Transfers",
      "values": [],
      "children": [
        {
          "key": "uploads",
          "label": "Uploads",
          "values": [],
          "children": [
            {
              "key": "upload_data",
              "label": "Total uploaded: %s",
              "values": [ { "type": "bytes", "value": 13314398208 } ],
              "children": []
            },
            {
              "key": "ul_dl_ratio",
              "label": "Session UL:DL Ratio (Total): %s",
              "values": [ { "type": "string", "value": "1 : 769.34 (1 : 1125.54)" } ],
              "ratio": { "session": 769.34, "total": 1125.54 },
              "children": []
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

A per-client-software version row (note `label_value`, and an `extra` that is a percentage of the parent here), and a sentinel value (note the additive `token`):

```json
{
  "key": "client_version",
  "label_value": "v0.70b",
  "label": "v0.70b: %s",
  "values": [ { "type": "integer", "value": 42, "extra": { "type": "double", "value": 12.5 } } ],
  "children": []
}
```

```json
{
  "label": "Max Connection Limit Reached: %s",
  "values": [ { "type": "string", "value": "Never", "token": "never" } ],
  "children": []
}
```

**Errors:** `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `GET /api/v0/stats/graphs/{graph}`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

Time-series points behind the desktop Statistics graphs.

`{graph}` is one of `download_speed`, `upload_speed`, `connections`, `kad_nodes`.

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `interval` | int, `1`–`3600` | `1` | Seconds between samples. Changes what amuled is asked for, so it changes the reach of the window: `interval=10` covers ten times as long at a tenth the resolution. |
| `width` | int, `0`–`1800` | full window | Tails the response to the last `N` samples. Applied after the fetch, so it does not change what is requested, so it never changes the time span each sample covers. `0` means the full window, same as omitting it. |

```json
{
  "graph": "connections",
  "unit": "count",
  "interval_seconds": 1,
  "max_points": 1800,
  "points": [
    { "t": "2026-06-14T09:40:00Z", "t_unix": 1781430000, "value": 42, "active_downloads": 7, "active_uploads": 4 },
    { "t": "2026-06-14T09:40:01Z", "t_unix": 1781430001, "value": 44, "active_downloads": 8, "active_uploads": 4 }
  ],
  "session": {
    "download_bytes": 12400000000,
    "upload_bytes": 980000000,
    "kad_node_seconds": 5400000,
    "duration_seconds": 86400
  }
}
```

Each point has `t` (ISO-8601 UTC), `t_unix` (unix seconds) and `value`, spaced by `interval_seconds`. `unit` is `"bytes_per_second"` for the two speed graphs and `"count"` for the other two.

`max_points` is how many points this daemon can answer with before it starts repeating records; `points` is never longer than it. It is not a constant across daemons, so a client that wants the deepest window available should read it rather than assume 1800.

**`connections` only:** each point also carries `active_downloads` (peers being pulled from) and `active_uploads` (peers being pushed to), alongside `value`, which stays the total connection count. Against an amuled that does not report them the two keys are **omitted entirely** rather than sent as `0`, so "not reported" is distinguishable from "nothing was transferring". They are all-or-nothing: either every point in a response has them or none does.

**`session`** carries this-session figures so a client doesn't need a separate roundtrip:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `download_bytes` / `upload_bytes` | Bytes transferred this session. Granularity is 1 KiB — amuled tracks these in kibibytes and truncates before sending. |
| `kad_node_seconds` | **Not a transfer figure.** The running per-second sum of the Kad node count, i.e. node·seconds. Divide by `duration_seconds` for the session-average node count, which is its only use. |
| `duration_seconds` | Daemon uptime at the newest point. `0` if the daemon does not report it. Divide any of the three figures above by it to get the session average the desktop plots. |

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (`interval` or `width` non-numeric or out of range), `404 not_found` (unknown graph name), `503 ec_unavailable`.

### Search

The search surface is admin-only because firing a global ed2k search has real network cost.

#### `GET /api/v0/search`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

Lists every search amuled currently holds — including ones started by a **different** client (another amuleapi request, the monolithic GUI, an amulegui session). Each call is a direct round trip to amuled (`EC_OP_SEARCH_LIST`), independent of the Refresher-maintained `m_state` cache, so a search this process never saw a `POST /search` for still shows up here as soon as amuled is holding it. [`GET /search/{id}/results`](#get-apiv0searchidresults) can then fetch that same `search_id` — on a cache miss it does its own one-off `EC_OP_SEARCH_LIST` check before returning `404`, so a search this endpoint just listed is never a dead end there.

```json
{
  "searches": [
    { "search_id": 42, "query": "ubuntu desktop iso", "kind": "global", "state": "finished", "started_at": 1751000000, "result_count": 182 },
    { "search_id": 43, "query": "debian",             "kind": "kad",    "state": "running",  "started_at": 1751000042, "result_count": 57  },
    { "search_id": 44, "query": "SomePeerNick",       "kind": "browse", "state": "running",  "client_ecid": 621,       "result_count": 237 }
  ],
  "total": 3,
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 3
}
```

This is a list endpoint like the others: it takes `?limit`, `?offset`, `?sort` and `?order`, and carries the same `total` / `offset` / `limit` trio. See [List pagination and sorting](#list-pagination-and-sorting); the sort keys are `search_id`, `query`, `started_at` and `result_count`.

`search_id` is the value that fills `{id}` on every search-scoped path: [`GET /search/{id}/results`](#get-apiv0searchidresults) to read its hits, [`POST /search/{id}/stop`](#post-apiv0searchidstop) to stop it, [`DELETE /search/{id}`](#delete-apiv0searchid) to free it. `kind` is `"local"` | `"global"` | `"kad"` | `"browse"`. The first three are the vocabulary `POST /search`'s `type` accepts; `"browse"` is reported only, for a "View Files" listing of one peer's share, which is started through the client endpoints rather than by a query. `state` is `"running"` | `"finished"` | `"idle"`, same vocabulary and meaning as `GET /search/{id}/results`'s `progress.state`.

For a `"browse"` entry, `state` and the results endpoint's `progress.percent` come from the browse's own lifecycle rather than from a query's: the request being sent is `"running"`, and the peer having answered, denied the request, or disconnected mid-list is `"finished"` — a browse is never reported as `"idle"`. `percent` is the share of the peer's directory list received so far, so it climbs while the listing streams in rather than jumping straight from `0` to `100`.

Browsing a peer that is **already being browsed** returns the id already in flight rather than starting a second one, so this list holds one entry per browsed peer, not one per request.

`query` is the daemon's name for the search. For a `"browse"` that is **the peer's nickname**, not a query string — a browse has no query. `client_ecid` is the browsed peer's ecid and is present **only** on browse entries, so a consumer can tell whose share is being listed and cross-reference [`GET /clients`](#get-apiv0clients); it is omitted entirely on an ordinary search.

`started_at` is the Unix second amuleapi started the search, and it is the **only recency signal on this list**: entries arrive ordered by `search_id`, and id order is not start order, because Kad search ids carry a high-bit mask and therefore always sort above eD2k ones. Ask for `?sort=started_at&order=desc` when you need "the newest search".

It is **omitted** for any search this `amuleapi` process did not start itself — one begun by another client, by the desktop GUI, or restored from the daemon's on-disk ring after a restart. The daemon ships no timestamp of its own, so there is nothing to report for those; treat a missing `started_at` as *unknown*, not as oldest.

`result_count` is how many results the daemon currently holds for that search. It matches the `total` that [`GET /search/{id}/results`](#get-apiv0searchidresults) reports for the same id once the search has finished; while one is still running the two can differ by a fetch, because this number comes straight off the daemon's live index and `total` counts what amuleapi last pulled into its cache. It counts top-level hits only: grouped alternative filenames ride their parent's `children[]` and are not counted separately. On a `"browse"` entry it is the files received from the peer so far. Like every other field on this listing it is a snapshot at request time, so a running search's count climbs between calls.

It exists so a client that adopts the whole list and fetches each search's results lazily — on first activation of a tab, rather than all at once at load — has a number to label an unopened tab with. It is **omitted**, not zeroed, when the daemon does not report it: a daemon older than this field sends nothing, and "does not report counts" has to stay distinguishable from "this search found nothing". Same rule as `client_ecid` and `started_at` above.

amuled only tracks multiple concurrent searches for clients that advertise multi-search support; `amuleapi` does, so this always reflects the full live set. `searches` is an empty array when amuled holds no searches, never an error.

**Errors:** `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/search`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Kicks off a new search. amuleapi supports **several concurrent searches** — a new search does NOT stop or wipe the others. amuled allocates a globally-unique `search_id` for each start and returns it; every subsequent results/stop/more call names that id in the path. There is no implicit "current search": keep the id you are given, or re-discover it through [`GET /search`](#get-apiv0search).

**Body:**

```json
{
  "query":     "ubuntu desktop iso",
  "type":      "global",
  "file_type": "iso",
  "extension": "iso",
  "min_size":  1000000000,
  "max_size":  5000000000,
  "min_avail": 5
}
```

Only `query` is required. `type` defaults to `"global"`; valid values are `"local"`, `"global"`, `"kad"`. A `"global"`/`"local"` (ed2k) search and a `"kad"` search run independently and can be in flight at the same time; starting one never disturbs the other.

**Response:** `202 Accepted`, with a `Location: /api/v0/search/{search_id}` header and the created search as the body -- the same row [`GET /search`](#get-apiv0search) lists, so it can go straight into a collection the client already keeps:

```json
{
  "search_id":   42,
  "query":       "ubuntu desktop iso",
  "kind":        "global",
  "state":       "running",
  "client_ecid": null,
  "started_at":  1750412400
}
```

Keep the `search_id` to read this search's results/progress or to stop it. This is one of the two creations that answer with the resource, because `EC_OP_SEARCH_START` really does hand one back; the ones whose EC op answers success or failure and nothing more are a bare `202` with no body.

**Errors:** `502 amuled_rejected` (daemon returned no search_id), `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `GET /api/v0/search/{id}/results`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

**Path:** `{id}` — the `search_id` to read, from [`POST /search`](#post-apiv0search) or [`GET /search`](#get-apiv0search). Required. A non-numeric segment or `0` is `400 bad_request`, never a fallback to some other search. An id that names no live search (never started anywhere, freed, or evicted from amuled's ring — see below) returns `404 not_found`, distinct from a known-but-empty search which returns an idle/empty envelope.

Returns one search's results buffer at the moment of the call PLUS a progress envelope so an empty `results` array isn't ambiguous between "search not started", "search in flight with no hits yet", and "search finished with zero hits".

This endpoint does NOT busy-wait — it returns whatever amuled has in its result buffer right now. A client that wants to wait for completion should poll while `progress.state == "running"`. While a search is **running** the refresher polls amuled (`EC_OP_SEARCH_RESULTS` + `EC_OP_SEARCH_PROGRESS`, addressed by `search_id`) every tick, so this GET reads straight from that snapshot and successive polls see the growing result set with no extra EC roundtrip.

Once a search is **finished** the refresher stops polling it, so this endpoint refreshes it **on read** instead, coalesced by a ~1 s TTL. That is what keeps a finished search's results live rather than frozen at the moment it completed: a Kad notes lookup started on one of its hits reports back, and a hit you download from it starts reading `status: "downloaded"` / `already_have: true`. Repeated polling of a finished search costs at most one EC roundtrip per second, not one per request.

`POST /search` is one way a search becomes readable; an unknown `search_id` (one this session never started) triggers a one-off `EC_OP_SEARCH_LIST` check before the `404`, and once confirmed it is polled every tick from there — so a search another client (or the monolithic GUI) started is readable here too, not just listable via [`GET /search`](#get-apiv0search).

amuled keeps a bounded ring of recent searches (20). A search evicted from that ring (because 20 newer searches were started) is reported to amuleapi as expired: its slot is retired as `finished` and reads with its `search_id` then return `404`.

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "hash":         "8b54a3c2...",
      "name":         "example-distribution-26.04-amd64.iso",
      "size":         3825205248,

      "status":       "new",
      "type":         "videos",
      "directory":    "",
      "media":        { "length_s": 5400, "bitrate": 1500, "codec": "h264", "artist": "", "album": "", "title": "" },

        { "ecid": 621, "name": "example-distribution-26.04.iso", "hash": "8b54a3c2...", "sources": { "total": 40, "complete": 22 }, "directory": "" },
        { "ecid": 622, "name": "example_distro_2604_amd64.iso",  "hash": "8b54a3c2...", "sources": { "total": 10, "complete":  3 }, "directory": "" }
      ],
      "kad_comment_search_running": false,
      "comments": []
    }
  ],
  "search_id": 42,
  "query": "ubuntu desktop iso",
  "progress": {
    "state":    "running",
    "kind":     "kad",
    "percent":  67
  }
}
```

Each result carries `sources` as a nested `{total, complete}` object — `total` is the swarm size amuled reports and `complete` is how many of those hold the file complete. `already_have` is `true` when you are currently downloading the file or already have it completed/shared; it is `false` for a fresh result and for one you have canceled/removed (a canceled result is re-downloadable, so it does not read as held). `rating` is amuled's aggregated quality rating (`0` when unrated). `status` is this result's download status on your node — `"new"` / `"downloaded"` / `"queued"` / `"canceled"` / `"queued_canceled"`. `type` is the file-type token derived from the filename extension (same tokens as the shared-detail [`file_type`](#get-apiv0sharedhash), e.g. `"videos"` / `"audio"`; `""` when the name has no extension). `media` is the audio/video [media metadata](#media-metadata) object (same shape as the file-detail endpoints), and is **omitted entirely** for a hit that carries no metadata (most global/Kad results), matching the blank Length/Bitrate/Codec columns in the desktop search list. **Unlike `media` on `GET /downloads/{hash}` and `GET /shared/{hash}`, which amuled probed locally, `media` on a search result is whatever the responding server advertised.** It is not verified against the file and can contradict it — a `.pdf` reporting a runtime and a video codec is a real observed result — so treat it as a hint, not as probed metadata.

`directory` is the folder this file sits in **inside a browsed peer's share** — the desktop search list's *Directories* column. It is populated only for results filed from a peer's shared-file listing (see [peer browse](#post-apiv0clientsecidshared_files)) and is `""` on every ordinary server/Kad hit, which never carries it. It is per-result rather than per-search: two copies of one file in different folders of the same share group under a single parent and each keeps its own folder, exactly as the desktop shows them, which is why `children[]` entries carry it too.

`search_id` and `query` identify the search these results belong to. `search_id` echoes the path so clients can key a view on the response alone; `query` is what the search was started with, so a client that adopted an id from [`GET /search`](#get-apiv0search) can label it without a second call. For a **browse**, `query` is the peer's nickname rather than a query string. `query` is `""` only for a search discovered before amuled reported a name for it.

`children` is the result-grouping tree: amuled collapses hits that are the **same file** (same ed2k hash **and** size) but advertised under **different filenames** into one parent row, and `children[]` holds the alternative names. Each child carries the parent's `hash` (that's why they group), its own `sources`, and a distinct `ecid` — pass that `ecid` to [`POST /search/results/{hash}/download`](#post-apiv0searchresultshashdownload) to download the file **under that chosen filename**. `children` is always present and is an empty array for a hit seen under a single name. The top-level `results[]` contains parents only — a child never appears as its own top-level entry.

`kad_comment_search_running` and `comments` carry the file's community ratings/comments fetched from Kad. Unlike a download — whose comments come from connected sources — a search result has no sources, so `comments` is populated purely by an on-demand Kad notes lookup you start with [`POST /search/results/{hash}/comments`](#post-apiv0searchresultshashcomments). `kad_comment_search_running` is `true` while that lookup is in flight and flips back to `false` when it finishes; `comments` is an empty array until notes arrive, each entry shaped like a download comment (`username` / `filename` / `rating` / `comment`, with `username` the responding node's IP or `Kad user`). Both fields are always present.

The `progress` object carries the same `state` / `kind` / `percent` fields as the [`search_progress`](EVENTS.md#search_progress) SSE event, so REST pollers and stream consumers interpret progress identically. (The event additionally carries a `results` count, since — unlike this response — it has no `results` array beside it.)

- `state` — `"running"` while the search is in flight, `"finished"` once amuled reports completion, `"idle"` when no search has run this session. This single field is canonical and replaces the older `complete` / `active` booleans (derive them as `complete = state == "finished"`, `active = state == "running"`).
- `kind` — the originally-requested search type (`"local"` | `"global"` | `"kad"` | `"browse"`).
- `percent` — `[0, 100]`, computed by amuled for every search kind from its `EC_TAG_SEARCH_LIFECYCLE_PERCENT` tag. For **global** it is the real server-queue progress. For **Kad** — which has no measurable mid-flight progress — it is a cosmetic time-ramp off the fixed 45 s keyword-search lifetime, capped at 99 until amuled authoritatively reports completion (`EC_TAG_SEARCH_LIFECYCLE_STATE` = finished), at which point it snaps to 100. Treat the Kad value as a liveliness indicator, not an accurate estimate.

A client that wants to wait for completion polls while `state == "running"`. Because amuled now reports the lifecycle state directly (no sentinel decode), `state == "running"` unambiguously means in-flight even for Kad — there is no longer any "is `percent: 0` a stalled Kad search or no search at all?" ambiguity; check `state` instead. A Kad search that hits its result cap (`SEARCHKEYWORD_TOTAL`, 300) before the 45 s deadline finishes early — `state` flips to `finished` and `percent` jumps to 100 ahead of the ramp.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (bad `{id}`), `404 not_found` (no such search), `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/search/{id}/stop`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Stops one search. No request body. Its cached results stay readable until it is freed or evicted, so a consumer viewing the search keeps seeing the set it was just looking at. Sibling searches are untouched.

**Response:** `204 No Content`. The same status [`DELETE /search/{id}`](#delete-apiv0searchid) answers with: what separates the two is that the results survive this one.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (bad `{id}`), `404 not_found` (no such search), `405`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `DELETE /api/v0/search/{id}`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Stops the search **and frees it**: amuled drops it from its result ring and amuleapi drops its slot, so [`GET /search/{id}/results`](#get-apiv0searchidresults) for it then returns `404`. Sibling searches are untouched. Use this when a consumer is done with a search rather than just pausing it; use `POST /search/{id}/stop` to halt the in-flight query but keep the results.

Freeing a search delivers a [`search_closed`](EVENTS.md#search_closed) event to every SSE subscriber, so other clients holding a view on it find out immediately.

**Response:** `204 No Content`.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (bad `{id}`), `404 not_found` (no such search), `405`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/search/{id}/more`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Widens a running **Kad** search — the desktop's **"More"** button. It re-asks the Kad peers already queried for a wider result frontier. No body.

Kad-only and running-only, matching what the desktop button allows rather than what the core tolerates: amuled turns a `more` on a non-Kad or finished search into a silent no-op, so both are rejected here instead of being answered with a misleading `202`.

**Response:** `202 Accepted`, no body - the reask was performed, or could not be performed *yet* but may be on a later press. The terminal case is the `409` below, so the status code is the whole answer.

**When it can no longer be widened:** `409 Conflict`, code `kad_more_exhausted`. Kad allows at most **4** reasks per search, and stops accepting them entirely once the search enters its stopping window — which begins 20 s before a keyword search's 45 s life ends, or as soon as it has collected 300 answers. In practice that means `more` only does something during roughly the first half of a search; past that, this is the answer. Disable the control for that search when you see it: nothing about that search will make it widenable again, and re-running the query is the way to get more (a fresh `POST /search` succeeds immediately and returns a new `search_id`).

A `202` does **not** promise a reask went out. A press made while no already-responded peer is left un-reasked also answers `202`, because that clears the moment another peer answers and retrying is the right next action. The distinction the status carries is *terminal* versus *not terminal*, which is what a UI acts on; the daemon's log line distinguishes all the individual outcomes for anyone debugging.

Note that a successful reask changes neither `progress.percent` nor `progress.state` — the Kad percent is a wall-clock ramp off the search's own start time. The response is the only signal; do not try to infer the outcome from the progress envelope.

**Older daemons.** A daemon predating this reports nothing, and amuleapi keeps answering `202` for every press rather than guessing. Absent is *unknown*, never *exhausted*.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (bad `{id}`, a non-Kad search, or one that has already finished), `400 amuled_rejected`, `403 forbidden` (guest), `404 not_found` (no such search), `405`, `409 kad_more_exhausted`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### Related-files search

There is no endpoint for the desktop's **"Search related files (eD2k, local server)"** action, and none is needed: the GUI simply composes a magic keyword and starts an ordinary local search. Do the same.

```sh
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"related::8b54a3c2...::0a1b2c3d...","type":"local"}' \
  "http://$HOST/api/v0/search"
```

The query is the literal prefix `related` followed by one or more `::`-separated 32-char hex MD4 hashes — one per file you want related hits for (the desktop passes every selected result). `type` must be `"local"`: the request is answered by the ed2k server you are connected to, and there is no Kad or global equivalent.

Not every server implements related search. Check the connected server's capability first rather than reading an empty result set as "nothing related": [`GET /api/v0/servers`](#get-apiv0servers) reports `related_search` among each server's flags, and the desktop refuses the action outright when it is absent.

#### `POST /api/v0/search/results/{hash}/download`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Promote a search result into the transfer queue. Equivalent to clicking "Download" on a desktop search row.

**Body:** `{ "category": 0, "ecid": 621 }` — both optional. `category` is the download category (default `0`). `ecid` selects one grouped **child** by its `results[].children[].ecid`, so the file downloads **under that child's filename**; omit it to download the parent (the aggregated/highest-source name). Since grouped children share the parent's hash, `{hash}` alone can't disambiguate them — `ecid` is how you pick a specific advertised name.

**Response:** `202 Accepted`, no body. `hash` came from the URL and `category` is the value the request supplied; the download itself reports the category it landed in.

#### `GET /api/v0/search/results/{hash}/comments`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

Community ratings/comments for a single search result — the Kad notes retrieved so far plus the running flag. The same data rides each result on [`GET /search/{id}/results`](#get-apiv0searchidresults); this per-hash endpoint mirrors [`GET /downloads/{hash}/comments`](#get-apiv0downloadshashcomments) for polling one result after starting a lookup.

The route is deliberately **not** nested under a search id: amuled runs one Kad notes lookup per hash and fans the notes out to every result carrying it, so the lookup is not scoped to one search. This endpoint refreshes whichever search owns the hit before answering, which is what makes the flag below observable on a search that has already finished.

```json
{
  "count": 2,
  "kad_comment_search_running": false,
  "comments": [
    { "username": "203.0.113.7", "filename": "example-distribution-26.04-amd64.iso", "rating": 5, "comment": "Verified good, fast sources." },
    { "username": "Kad user",    "filename": "example-distribution-26.04-amd64.iso", "rating": 4, "comment": "Works." }
  ]
}
```

`kad_comment_search_running` is `true` while an on-demand Kad notes lookup (triggered by the `POST` below) is in flight; poll until it returns to `false` to know the lookup finished. `username` is the responding Kad node's IP, or `Kad user` when the note carries no IP.

**Polling is the only mechanism here — there is no event to wait for.** [`comments_updated`](EVENTS.md#comments_updated) is emitted for downloads only and never fires for a search hit, so a client that starts a lookup polls this endpoint (or the results list) while `kad_comment_search_running` is `true`.

**Errors:** `404 not_found` (no live search result with that hash), `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/search/results/{hash}/comments`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Trigger an on-demand Kad notes lookup for a search result you have not downloaded. This is the search-side equivalent of [`POST /downloads/{hash}/comments`](#post-apiv0downloadshashcomments): the lookup is asynchronous on amuled (up to ~45 s), and retrieved ratings/comments then appear via the `GET` above and on the result's `comments` in the search list.

**Response:** `202 Accepted`, with no body.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request` (malformed hash), `403 forbidden` (guest token — the lookup makes the daemon do network work, so it is `ADMIN`-only), `404 not_found` (no live search result with that hash), `400 amuled_rejected` (Kad down, or a search is already using this hash — retry shortly), `503 ec_unavailable`.

### Assets

#### `GET /flags/{code}.png`

**Auth:** `NONE` — public artwork, no per-installation data. `HEAD` is accepted too; any other method is `405 method_not_allowed`.

The country-flag image for a `country_code`. `/clients`, `/servers` and their SSE diffs carry the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (see [`GET /api/v0/clients`](#get-apiv0clients)); this is where the matching artwork comes from, so a frontend does not have to ship its own flag set.

Note the path is deliberately **outside** `/api/v0/` — it is an image an `<img src>` points at, not a JSON resource, and it is versioned by the daemon build rather than by the API contract.

`{code}` must be exactly two **lowercase** ASCII letters, or the literal `unknown` for the "??" placeholder the desktop GUI falls back to when a code is empty or unrecognised. The bytes are the 16×11 famfamfam PNGs compiled into the daemon binary — the same artwork the desktop draws — so the route behaves identically whether or not `[Server]/StaticRoot` is set, and never touches the file system.

```sh
curl -s http://$HOST/flags/de.png -o de.png
curl -s http://$HOST/flags/unknown.png -o unknown.png
```

**Response:** `200 OK`, `Content-Type: image/png`, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400`.

Responses carry an `ETag` and honour `If-None-Match` with `304 Not Modified` like every other `GET` (see [ETag and conditional GET](#etag-and-conditional-get)). The `max-age` is what keeps a peer list full of `<img>` tags from issuing one conditional request per country on every reload; the artwork can only change with a new daemon build, and a day bounds how long an upgraded daemon keeps serving the old image.

The response is never `Content-Encoding: gzip` — a PNG is already entropy-coded, so the server skips compression for it.

**Errors:** `404 not_found` for anything that is neither two lowercase letters nor `unknown` (uppercase, wrong length, digits, another extension), and for a well-formed code the famfamfam set has no artwork for — it covers 248 of the assignable alpha-2 codes, so a resolvable country can legitimately have no flag. Render the code as text, or fall back to `unknown.png`, in that case. `400 bad_request` for paths carrying traversal tokens, per [Path validation](#path-validation).

Peers whose country could not be resolved — GeoIP disabled, unsupported by the build, or a private/unmatched address — come back with `country_code: ""`. There is no per-country image to request in that case; draw nothing, or `unknown.png` for parity with the desktop list.

---

### Chat

Conversations with peers, backed by the chat session store in `amuled`. The store is shared: a message sent from the desktop GUI, from amulegui or through this API lands in the same transcript, and every client sees the same conversation.

A conversation is keyed on `{peer}` = `"<ip>:<port>"` (for example `203.0.113.42:4662`). That is the readable form of the internal id the EC wire already uses, it is stable across peer reconnects — unlike an ECID — and it needs no identifier of its own. A `{peer}` that is not four dotted octets plus a port is a `400`.

The store is **in memory**: an `amuled` restart empties every conversation, exactly as the desktop's own transcript dies with its notebook tab. Retention is bounded at 200 messages per conversation and 50 conversations, evicting the least recently active first.

Message `id` is monotonic per `amuled` process and never reused, which makes it a safe polling cursor: `since_id` never returns a duplicate and never skips a message. It resets when the daemon restarts, which also empties the store.

Every endpoint here answers `503 ec_unsupported` when the connected `amuled` does not serve chat.

#### `GET /api/v0/chats`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://$HOST/api/v0/chats"
```

```json
{
  "chats": [
    {
      "peer":            "203.0.113.42:4662",
      "ip":              "203.0.113.42",
      "port":            4662,
      "name":            "alice",
      "client_ecid":     4382,
      "friend_ecid":     12,
      "online":          true,
      "message_count":   14,
      "last_msg_id":     91,
      "last_message_at": 1786652714,
      "last_message":    { "id": 91, "direction": "in", "text": "thanks!", "timestamp": 1786652714 }
    }
  ],
  "total": 1, "offset": 0, "limit": 1
}
```

`name` falls back to `"IP: <ip> Port: <port>"` when the core has no nickname for the peer, matching what the desktop shows; the same string appears in the SSE payload. `client_ecid` is `0` when the peer is offline, `friend_ecid` is `0` when the peer is not a friend — join against [`GET /clients`](#get-apiv0clients) and [`GET /friends`](#get-apiv0friends). `online` is simply `client_ecid != 0`.

`last_message` is omitted for a conversation that holds none. The full transcript is deliberately **not** on the list: 50 conversations at 200 messages each would be 10 000 objects per read. Use the messages endpoint below.

Served from the refresher snapshot — no EC roundtrip per request. Standard [list envelope](#list-pagination-and-sorting); sortable on `last_message_at` and `name`.

**Errors:** `503 ec_unsupported`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `GET /api/v0/chats/{peer}/messages`

**Auth:** `GUEST`

**Query:** `since_id=N` (only messages with `id > N`), `tail=N` (the last N of that window, max `100000`). This selects a tail rather than a page, which is why it is not called `limit`: on the list endpoints `limit` is a window paired with `offset`, and one word meaning two things is a rule a client has to learn twice.

```json
{
  "peer": "203.0.113.42:4662",
  "messages": [
    { "id": 90, "direction": "out", "text": "hi",      "timestamp": 1786652700 },
    { "id": 91, "direction": "in",  "text": "thanks!", "timestamp": 1786652714 }
  ],
  "total": 14,
  "last_msg_id": 91
}
```

`direction` is `"in"` (from the peer) or `"out"` (sent by us — from **any** client: this API, amulegui, or the desktop GUI). `timestamp` is stamped by the core when the message was received or sent. `total` counts everything the store holds for this conversation, not the returned window.

**Errors:** `404 not_found` (no such conversation), `400 bad_request` (malformed `{peer}` or query), `503 ec_unsupported`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/chats/{peer}/messages`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

**Body:** `{ "text": "hello" }` — non-empty, at most 1024 bytes.

```sh
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"hello"}' "http://$HOST/api/v0/chats/203.0.113.42:4662/messages"
```

```json
{ "peer": "203.0.113.42:4662",
  "message": { "id": 92, "direction": "out", "text": "hello" } }
```

The created message stays in the body: no per-message `GET` defines a shape for it, so the `id` and the timestamp the store assigned are only readable here.

The core creates the conversation if it does not exist, so this doubles as "start a chat with this address" — an unknown `{peer}` is not a `404` here.

Returns `202 Accepted`, not `200`: the core acknowledges that it queued the message on the peer connection, not that the peer received it. An unreachable peer is not an error — the desktop behaves the same, optimistically showing `*** Connecting to Client ***`.

**Errors:** `400 bad_request`, `503 ec_unsupported`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

#### `POST /api/v0/friends/{ecid}/messages`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Message a friend by friend ECID. This is the form that reaches an **offline** friend: the daemon resolves the ECID to the friend's stored address, so no live connection is needed.

**Body:** `{ "text": "hello" }`

**Response:** `202 Accepted` → `{ "peer": "203.0.113.42:4662", "message": { … } }`, so the caller learns the conversation key to read back.

**Errors:** `404 not_found` (no friend with that ECID), plus the set above.

#### `POST /api/v0/clients/{ecid}/messages`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

The peer-addressed form, for a caller holding a peer row that should not have to compose an `ip:port` key. Same body and response as above.

**Errors:** `404 not_found` (no live peer with that ECID), plus the set above.

#### `DELETE /api/v0/chats/{peer}`

**Auth:** `ADMIN`

Closes the conversation: drops it from the core store and resets the peer's chat state.

**Response:** `204 No Content`.

Closing is **global**, the same way closing a search tab frees the search for every client. A connected amulegui drops its tab on the next poll, and the desktop GUI closes its own; no client is left showing a conversation the core no longer has.

**Errors:** `404 not_found`, `400 bad_request`, `503 ec_unsupported`, `503 ec_unavailable`.

## Error code catalog

Every error code emitted by `/api/v0/*`, sorted by what triggered it. Two codes are emitted with **two different statuses** depending on the cause, so a client that switches on `code` alone must also look at the status for those.

| Code | Status | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| `bad_request` | 400 | Body, query, or path-segment validation failed. Body parse depth-cap rejects also surface here. |
| `amuled_rejected` | 400, 502 | amuled rejected the EC operation and the message carries its reason verbatim (400); or amuled answered but its reply was unusable, e.g. no `search_id` came back from a search or a browse (502). |
| `request_timeout` | 408 | The request was not completed within the 10 s read timeout. |
| `unauthorized` | 401 | Missing token, bad signature, expired, revoked, or `iat` invariants failed. |
| `invalid_credentials` | 401, 403 | `/auth/login` password didn't match any role (401); or `PATCH /auth/passwords` was given a `current_password` that does not match (403). |
| `forbidden` | 403 | Authenticated as `guest` but the endpoint requires `admin`. |
| `not_found` | 404 | Resource doesn't exist (unknown hash, ECID, graph name, or no such endpoint). |
| `method_not_allowed` | 405 | Wrong HTTP verb for the route. The response carries an `Allow` header listing the methods this resource does support. |
| `conflict` | 409 | The request is valid but the daemon cannot serve it as asked: it was built without support for the option being set, or the client named on an A4AF request is not an A4AF source of that download. |
| `partfile_unsupported` | 409 | Verify Local Data, or a content download, requested on a file that is still an incomplete partfile. |
| `not_shared` | 409 | A comment or rating was posted against a file that is not shared. |
| `not_completed` | 409 | `clear_completed` named a `hash` that is not a completed download. |
| `completed_use_clear_completed` | 409 | A bulk `DELETE /downloads` matched a completed download; use `clear_completed` for those. |
| `kad_more_exhausted` | 409 | `POST /search/{id}/more` on a Kad search that can no longer be widened — its 4-reask budget is spent, or it has entered the stopping window Kad begins 20 s before a keyword search ends. Terminal for that search; re-run the query for more. |
| `update_check_unavailable` | 409 | `POST /version/check` cannot run — the daemon has no update-check capability. |
| `payload_too_large` | 413 | Request body exceeds the 1 MiB limit. The connection closes after the response. |
| `range_not_satisfiable` | 416 | A `Range` on [`GET /shared/{hash}/content`](#get-apiv0sharedhashcontent) starts at or past EOF. `Content-Range: bytes */<size>` accompanies the response. |
| `rate_limited` | 429 | Per-IP failure bucket full. `Retry-After: <seconds>` accompanies the response. |
| `update_check_throttled` | 429 | `POST /version/check` was throttled by the daemon; try again shortly. |
| `headers_too_large` | 431 | Request headers exceed the 16 KiB limit. The connection closes after the response. |
| `internal_error` | 500 | A handler failed internally — hash decode or serialization. The body is generic; details land in the daemon's stderr. |
| `internal` | 500 | A handler threw. Raised by the HTTP layer's catch-all rather than by a handler, so it is distinct from `internal_error` above; a client that wants every server-side failure must match both. |
| `bad_gateway` | 502 | amuled returned an EC payload this endpoint could not decode. |
| `ec_unavailable` | 503 | EC connection not ready yet (cold start, transient amuled restart). |
| `ec_unsupported` | 503 | The connected amuled is too old to serve this route — the chat endpoints and `/known_clients`. |
| `login_disabled` | 503 | `/auth/login` reached but no admin AND no guest password configured. |
| `sessions_exhausted` | 503 | Too many concurrent streaming sessions. `Retry-After` accompanies the response. |
| `file_responses_exhausted` | 503 | Too many concurrent file responses (cap 6) on [`GET /shared/{hash}/content`](#get-apiv0sharedhashcontent). `Retry-After` accompanies the response. |
| `path_unavailable` | 503 | The shared file's on-disk directory has not yet arrived over EC. Transient; `Retry-After: 5` accompanies the response. |
| `ec_content_unreachable` | 503 | The shared file is not present on the filesystem running amuleapi — a deployment where amuleapi talks to a **remote** amuled. |
| `ec_content_mismatch` | 503 | The file at the resolved path disagrees in size with the shared file the hash names — the same remote-amuled split, resolving to an unrelated local file of the same name. |

`message` is human-readable and may change between releases. Pin on `code`.

## Backward compatibility

`/api/v0/` is frozen against any breaking change once released. Within a version only **additive** changes are made, and a conformant client must tolerate them:

- **New endpoints** may be added at any time.
- **New optional query parameters** may be added to existing endpoints, always with a backward-compatible default — omitting the parameter preserves the prior behaviour (as the list-pagination `limit`/`offset`/`sort`/`order` params did).
- **New fields** may be added to response bodies, and new optional fields to request bodies. Clients **MUST ignore unknown fields**, and must not depend on field order or on a field's absence.

Anything that could break a conformant client — renaming, removing, or retyping a field; changing a field's semantics or an endpoint's default behaviour; making an optional input required; or removing an endpoint — is deferred to the next version (`/api/v1/`) rather than applied in place.

`POST /api/v0/auth/login`'s default body shape (no token unless `?type=bearer`) IS a change from the very first amuleapi cuts; the legacy "token always in body" behaviour is reachable only via the opt-in. This is documented and committed.
