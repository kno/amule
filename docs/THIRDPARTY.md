# Third-party components

aMule binary distributions (AppImage, Flatpak, .deb, macOS bundle, Windows
installer) include code from third parties under their own permissive
licenses. This file reproduces the copyright notice and license terms for
each, as required by their respective binary-distribution clauses. aMule's
own code is under GPLv2-or-later — see [LICENSE.md](../LICENSE.md).

## picojson

JSON parser used by `libwebcommon` (the REST API + SSE auth surface
shared by amuleapi). License: BSD 2-Clause Simplified.

Upstream: <https://github.com/kazuho/picojson> — version 1.3.0,
vendored at [`src/libwebcommon/picojson.h`](../src/libwebcommon/picojson.h).

The vendored header is unmodified upstream 1.3.0; the
`PICOJSON_USE_INT64` toggle is defined at use sites rather than as a
modification to the header.

The bundled copy is used by default. Distributions may configure with
`-DUSE_SYSTEM_PICOJSON=ON` to use a system-installed `picojson.h` version
1.3.0 or newer instead.

## libutp

The uTP (Micro Transport Protocol) reference implementation, used by the
uTP transport when aMule is configured with `-DENABLE_UTP=YES`. License:
MIT.

Vendored at `src/extern/libutp`, from
<https://github.com/transmission/libutp> at commit
`490874c44a2ecf914404b0a20e043c9755fff47b` (version 3.4). The pinned
commit, the files omitted from the upstream tree, and the reason each was
omitted are recorded in `src/extern/libutp/AMULE_PROVENANCE.md`; no
vendored file is patched. `cmake/libutp.cmake` builds that copy, or links
a system-installed one with `-DUSE_SYSTEM_LIBUTP=YES`. Builds configured
with `-DENABLE_UTP=NO` (the default) compile no libutp code at all, and
this notice does not apply to them.

### Ported uTP transport code

The uTP transport shim in `src/Utp*.h` is not third-party code — it is
GPLv2-or-later like the rest of aMule — but the write-buffer thresholds,
the duplex-transfer heuristic and the transport-failure semantics are
ported from eMuleAI's `CUtpSocket`
(`srchybrid/eMuleAI/UtpSocket.cpp`). Both projects are GPL-2.0-or-later,
so the code may move, and the original copyright travels with it:

> Copyright (C) 2013 David Xanatos ( XanatosDavid (a) gmail.com / http://NeoLoader.to )
> Copyright (C) 2026 eMule AI

Those lines appear in the header of every file carrying ported code. Do
not remove them when editing those files.

## muleunit

Lightweight unit test framework used by the C++ test suite at
`unittests/tests/`. License: GNU LGPL v2.1.

Source ships at [`unittests/muleunit/`](../unittests/muleunit/); full
license text in
[`unittests/muleunit/license.txt`](../unittests/muleunit/license.txt).
The framework is statically linked into every test binary but is NOT
linked into shipped daemon binaries (`amule`, `amuled`, `amulegui`,
`amuleweb`, `amuleapi`), so the LGPL relinking clause does not constrain
end-user binary distribution.
