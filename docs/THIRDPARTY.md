# Third-party components

aMule binary distributions (AppImage, Flatpak, .deb, macOS bundle, Windows
installer) include code from third parties under their own permissive
licenses. This file reproduces the copyright notice and license terms for
each, as required by their respective binary-distribution clauses. aMule's
own code is under GPLv2-or-later — see [LICENSE.md](../LICENSE.md).

## picojson

JSON parser used by `libwebcommon` (the REST API + SSE auth surface
shared by amuleapi). License: BSD 2-Clause Simplified.

Upstream: <https://github.com/kazuho/picojson> — version 1.3.0,
vendored at [`src/libwebcommon/picojson.h`](../src/libwebcommon/picojson.h).

The vendored header is unmodified upstream 1.3.0; the
`PICOJSON_USE_INT64` toggle is defined at use sites rather than as a
modification to the header.

The bundled copy is used by default. Distributions may configure with
`-DUSE_SYSTEM_PICOJSON=ON` to use a system-installed `picojson.h` version
1.3.0 or newer instead.

## muleunit

Lightweight unit test framework used by the C++ test suite at
`unittests/tests/`. License: GNU LGPL v2.1.

Source ships at [`unittests/muleunit/`](../unittests/muleunit/); full
license text in
[`unittests/muleunit/license.txt`](../unittests/muleunit/license.txt).
The framework is statically linked into every test binary but is NOT
linked into shipped daemon binaries (`amule`, `amuled`, `amulegui`,
`amuleweb`, `amuleapi`), so the LGPL relinking clause does not constrain
end-user binary distribution.
