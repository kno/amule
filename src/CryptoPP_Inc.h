// cryptopp's headers are heavy on C++03 patterns: virtual dtors that bring in the deprecated
// implicit copy ctor (P0806 rule), and throw(...) dynamic exception specs formally removed in
// C++17. On Homebrew macOS the cryptopp include directory reaches consumers via CPATH (an `-I`
// alias) rather than as `-isystem`, so a strict deprecation-warning audit build (`-Wdeprecated-
// declarations -Wdeprecated-copy -Wdeprecated`) surfaces ~200 warnings from cryptopp headers alone.
// GCC's -Wdeprecated-copy does not decompose into the -with-user-provided-dtor sub-case, so this
// only bites Clang builds today; the pragma is scoped to Clang-known sub-flags for that reason.
// Local to cryptopp includes; nothing else in the translation unit is affected.
