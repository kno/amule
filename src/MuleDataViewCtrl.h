/**
 * Shared behaviour for aMule's wxDataViewCtrl-backed lists.
 *
 * The wxDataViewCtrl counterpart of CMuleListCtrl: the chrome every list needs and no list should
 * implement twice -- column widths and their persistence, the show/hide menu, the multi-column sort
 * chain, type-ahead selection, and the per-platform compensation the ports have had to grow.
 *
 * It owns no data. A subclass supplies its rows through GetDisplayOrder(), their label through
 * GetRowLabel(), and how two of them compare on a column through CompareByColumn(); everything else
 * here is written in terms of those three.
 *
 * Lists with a flat, row-addressed model should derive from CMuleVirtualDataViewCtrl instead, which
 * adds the item-identity bookkeeping on top of this.
