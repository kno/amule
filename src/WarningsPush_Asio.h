// Silences the deprecation diagnostics Boost.Asio's headers trip, across the includes that follow
// and nothing else. Close with WarningsPop.h.
//
// Asio gives several exception types a user-provided destructor alongside an implicit copy
// constructor, and its execution headers define constexpr statics out of line, which C++17 makes
// redundant. Both are deprecated and the -Werror=deprecated gate reaches them. Named exactly rather
// than a blanket suppression, for the reason in WarningsPush_CryptoPP.h.
//
// Measured with AppleClang 21 and Boost 1.92: without both suppressions ip/tcp.hpp produces 29
// errors under -Werror=deprecated, 27 redundant constexpr static definitions and 2 deprecated
// copies with a user-provided destructor. Each suppression is independently necessary.
//
// Only the wider closures need this: <boost/asio/ip/address.hpp> alone trips neither, measured at
// zero, which is why NetworkAddressAsio.h has no wrap.
//
// Deliberately unguarded: see WarningsPop.h.
