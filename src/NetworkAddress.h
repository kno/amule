/**
 * The internal, family-agnostic address type.
 *
 * aMule stores IP addresses as bare @c uint32 across Kademlia, the client list
 * and the IP filter. That representation cannot hold an IPv6 address, and it
 * carries two further defects that a plain widening would silently inherit:
 *
 *  - **Byte order is not in the type.** A @c uint32 IP in this tree is in one
 *    of two conventions depending on the call site, and the two are bridged by
 *    scattered @c wxUINT32_SWAP_ALWAYS calls. Which convention a value is in
 *    is documented in comments at best.
 *  - **Zero doubles as "no address".** So a client whose address is genuinely
 *    unknown is indistinguishable from one at @c 0.0.0.0.
 *
 * This type fixes both by construction. There is no implicit conversion to or
 * from @c uint32: every narrowing and widening goes through a named function
 * whose name states the byte order, and absence is a state of the object
 * rather than a magic value.
 *
 * ## Why this header pulls in no socket library
 *
 * The address used to be stored as an @c asio::ip::address, borrowing
 * asio's v4/v6 variant rather than restating it. That was cheap to write and
 * expensive to compile: this header is reached by eighteen public headers --
 * updownclient.h, ClientList.h, IPFilter.h, DownloadQueue.h among them -- so
 * asio ended up in the include closure of 155 of the 254 translation units in
 * src/, and it took two whole platforms down with it:
 *
 *  - Asio's @c ip/address.hpp pulls @c asio/detail/winsock_init.hpp, whose
 *    static initialiser references @c WSAStartup / @c WSACleanup. Every one of
 *    those 155 TUs therefore needed @c ws2_32 at link time, and the targets
 *    that do not link it failed on mingw-w64 -- for an address type that never
 *    opens a socket.
 *  - It is a large closure (about 1200 headers) compiled 155 times over for
 *    what is, in the end, sixteen bytes and a family tag.
 *
 * So the storage is now those sixteen bytes and that family tag, spelled out
 * here. Only the two operations that genuinely need a library -- parsing a
 * textual address and formatting one -- still use asio, and they live in
 * NetworkAddress.cpp where exactly one TU pays for them. Nothing about IPv6
 * text handling is hand-rolled: RFC 4291 zero compression, the IPv4-mapped
 * dotted-quad tail and scope-id suffixes are all still asio's job.
 *
 * A caller that needs the asio value itself -- the socket backend, and only
 * it -- gets it from NetworkAddressAsio.h, which is the one bridge and is
 * included by the TUs that truly open sockets.
 *
 * ## The two 32-bit conventions
 *
 * For the address @c 192.0.2.1:
 *
 * | Convention | Value | Used by |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | host order (numeric) | @c 0xC0000201 | Kademlia (`KadIPToString`) |
 * | network order | @c 0x010200C0 | ed2k core (`Uint32toStringIP`) |
 *
 * "Network order" is the name used in this type's API for what the rest of
 * aMule's comments call *anti-host order*: the four octets packed with the
 * first octet in the numerically least significant byte. On a little-endian
 * host that is the value obtained by loading four network-order bytes straight
 * into a @c uint32, which is how it arises in practice -- an ed2k packet field
 * read by CFileDataIO. The two conventions are exact byte reversals of each
 * other on every platform, which is why @c wxUINT32_SWAP_ALWAYS converts
 * between them unconditionally.
 *
 * Note that neither convention is the storage order. Internally the address is
 * always its octets in wire order, most significant first, so that the v4 and
 * v6 cases need no separate code path and the comparison rule below is one
 * lexicographic compare rather than a family switch.
 *
 * ## Comparison rule
 *
 * One rule, applied everywhere:
 *
 *  1. An absent address sorts before every present one, and equals only
 *     another absent address.
 *  2. IPv4 sorts before IPv6.
 *  3. Within a family, addresses sort by their octets, most significant
 *     first.
 *
 * IPv4-mapped forms are **not** normalised: @c ::ffff:192.0.2.1 is an IPv6
 * address, so it is neither equal to nor adjacent to the IPv4 address
 * @c 192.0.2.1. This keeps the ordering total with no two distinct addresses
 * comparing equal, which is what makes the type safe as a container key.
 * Callers that want the two treated alike must say so by calling Unmapped()
 * first.
