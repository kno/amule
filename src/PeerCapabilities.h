/**
 * The CT_MOD_MISCOPTIONS word aMule advertises, given what it can actually do
 * for a peer right now.
 *
 * Advertising a capability aMule does not have is worse than advertising
 * nothing: the peer opens a handshake that cannot complete and neither side
 * logs a reason. So each bit follows a transport that can carry a connection,
 * not a transport that was merely compiled in or merely bound. Those are
 * different questions, and the difference is not academic. Both shipped bits
 * draw that same line, each with its own gate:
 *
 *   - MOD_MISCOPT_NAT_TRAVERSAL (bit 1) follows whether this end can *serve* a
 *     uTP connection. A build configured with -DENABLE_UTP=YES has a
 *     utp_context and still drops every inbound uTP connection until the accept
 *     path is wired, so compiled and initialised is the equivalent of a bound
 *     socket: necessary, not sufficient. The gate is
 *     CUtpContext::CanServeConnections(), and it arrives here as the
 *     utpTransportCanServe argument.
 *   - MOD_MISCOPT_IPV6 (bit 2) follows *verified* inbound IPv6 connectivity,
 *     not a bound IPv6 socket. A socket bound behind a firewall that drops
 *     every inbound packet would have aMule advertising an address that never
 *     answers. That gate is
 *     DualStack::CLocalReachability::AdvertisedModMiscOptions() -- see
 *     src/IPv6Reachability.h -- because the reachability state lives there.
 *
 *   - MOD_MISCOPT_NAT_TRAVERSAL_QUIC (bit 4) follows whether this end can serve
 *     a QUIC NAT-T exchange, which is a strictly narrower question than whether
 *     ngtcp2 was linked: a build whose TLS credentials failed to come up
 *     answers no handshake at all. The gate is
 *     CQuicContext::CanServeConnections(), and it arrives here as the
 *     quicTransportCanServe argument. Getting this one wrong costs the peer
 *     more than the uTP equivalent does, because a peer that reads the bit
 *     waits out the whole 1500 ms capability window before falling back --
 *     see SelectNattFrameType() in NatTraversalPolicy.h.
 *
 * The gates are independent and compose by OR at the one place a handshake is
 * written, CUpDownClient::SendHelloTypePacket(). This function owns the two
 * transport halves only; it is not the whole word on the wire.
 *
 * Both transport answers travel as arguments rather than being read from a
 * macro here, so every branch is testable in the one build a test binary is.
 * They are separate arguments because the two transports fail independently: a
 * client can serve QUIC and not uTP, or the reverse, and one argument for both
 * would make a client advertise a transport it cannot serve.
 *
 * The two remaining bits stay off; each turns on in the change that ships its
 * feature. When the composed word is zero, no CT_MOD_MISCOPTIONS tag is
 * emitted at all: an absent tag and an all-zero one mean the same thing to
 * eMuleAI, and the absent one costs no bytes.
 *
 * @param utpTransportCanServe  whether this end can serve a uTP connection,
 *        i.e. a utp_context exists and an inbound uTP attempt on it would be
 *        handled rather than dropped. See CUtpContext::CanServeConnections().
 * @param quicTransportCanServe  the same question for QUIC. See
 *        CQuicContext::CanServeConnections().

/**
 * The most this build could ever advertise: the ceiling, not the word.
 *
 * Three bits can appear here. MOD_MISCOPT_IPV6 always does: the dual-stack code
 * is compiled unconditionally, so a build can always *reach* the point of
 * claiming IPv6 -- whether it does is a runtime question answered by
 * DualStack::CLocalReachability. MOD_MISCOPT_NAT_TRAVERSAL appears only with
 * -DENABLE_UTP=YES, because uTP needs libutp and is off by default (see
 * cmake/libutp.cmake). MOD_MISCOPT_NAT_TRAVERSAL_QUIC appears only with
 * -DENABLE_QUIC=YES, which needs ngtcp2 and its GnuTLS binding and is off by
 * default for a stronger reason still -- the dependency is not packageable on
 * every platform aMule ships on, so a macOS build can never reach this bit at
 * all (see cmake/ngtcp2.cmake and the platform table in the change's
 * design.md). The two remaining features do not exist in this tree, so they can
 * never appear. A bit that appears here without a transport compiled behind it
 * is a defect, which is what PeerCapabilitiesTest pins and what the
 * static_assert in CUpDownClient::SendHelloTypePacket() bounds the emitted word
 * against.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT what goes on the wire. A non-zero ceiling only makes
 * a bit possible; whether it is set is decided per handshake by the runtime
 * gates -- AdvertisedModMiscOptions() for the two transports and
 * DualStack::CLocalReachability::AdvertisedModMiscOptions() for IPv6 -- which
 * compose by OR in SendHelloTypePacket(). When the resulting word is zero, no
 * CT_MOD_MISCOPTIONS tag is emitted at all: an absent tag and an all-zero one
 * mean the same thing to eMuleAI, and the absent one costs no bytes.
