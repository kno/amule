/**
 * What identifies a peer, once a peer can be IPv6.
 *
 * aMule identified a peer by a 32-bit address, so an inbound IPv6 peer was
 * accepted by the socket and then dropped: `CClientList` had nothing to index
 * it under, and the ed2k UDP handlers had nothing to look it up by. The
 * decisions that widening needs are collected here, away from the app classes
 * that carry them out, so each one is a value function with a test rather than a
 * condition buried in a 3000-line file.
 *
 * Three separate questions live here, and they deliberately give different
 * answers for the same address:
 *
 *  - **Identity.** Two peers are the same peer iff they have the same index
 *    key. Aggregating distinct hosts here would merge them -- the failure this
 *    tree has already had once, when an absent address was banned as the key
 *    0.0.0.0 and every client with an unknown address read back as banned.
 *  - **Rate limiting.** A budget is per *subscriber*, which under IPv6 is not
 *    per address. Aggregating is the point here, and the amount of aggregation
 *    is a decision, not a detail.
 *  - **Routing an inbound datagram.** Some subsystems cannot represent an IPv6
 *    peer at all -- Kad by design, ed2k UDP obfuscation by protocol. Those
 *    boundaries are reported, never crossed with a fabricated address.
 *
 * Nothing here fabricates an address. Every function that cannot answer for an
 * address says so; an absent address stays absent all the way through.

 * address is many peers, so that match would name an arbitrary one of them --
