	 * per-peer metadata until the peer has handshaked once since that
	 * metadata existed, and ClientsWnd only fills a row's ip and port from
	 * metadata, so on an established clients.met the address-less rows are
	 * the older ones -- the ones the Known list exists to surface.
	 *
	 * The address requirement belongs to the hash-less record, which is why
	 * CAddFriend demands ip and port: entered by address, it has no other
	 * identifier.
	 *
	 * For a peer we are connected to the live client is the source of truth,
	 * not the row. A row only learns an address once the peer has told us its
	 * name, so a connected peer with an empty nickname has one the row does
	 * not, and CFriend's client constructor copies it from the client anyway.
