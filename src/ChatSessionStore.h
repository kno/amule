// The core's record of who we are chatting with and what was said.
//
// Chat used to exist only inside the monolithic GUI's notebook tabs, which left nothing for EC to
// serve and no way for two clients to agree on the transcript. This store moves the model into the
// core so the local GUI, amulegui and amuleapi are three views of one conversation rather than
// three private ones.
//
// Compiled into both `amule` and `amuled` -- no GUI dependency. Owned by CamuleApp, fed at the two
// existing choke points (CUpDownClient::ProcessChatMessage inbound, CClientList::SendChatMessage
// outbound).
//
// In-memory only: an amuled restart empties it, which is what the monolithic GUI already does (the
// transcript dies with the notebook page). Persisting it is a self-contained follow-up that needs
// no EC change.
//
// **Threading:** every mutator runs on the main thread, from the packet handlers and the EC request
// handlers, exactly like CClientList. No locking, deliberately -- a mutex here would imply off-
// thread callers that do not exist.
