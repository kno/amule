// amuleapi's admin/guest credentials: how they are hashed and how the amuleapi-passwords file is
// read and written.
//
// This lives in webcommon rather than in amuleapi because three processes need to agree on the
// format: amuleapi itself, amuled (applying a change pushed from amulegui over EC), and monolithic
// amule (applying a change made in its own preferences dialog). Exactly one implementation of the
// format, so the three can never drift apart.
//
// What is stored: a PHC-style string, self-describing so the parameters can change later without
// another format break:
//
//     pbkdf2-sha256$<iterations>$<salt-hex>$<hash-hex>
//
// The input to the KDF is the *MD5 hex* of the password, not the password itself. That is
// deliberate: aMule's preferences dialog hashes with MD5 before the value goes over EC, and EC
// sessions are not encrypted, so asking for the plaintext would put a new secret on the wire to
// gain nothing. Pre-hashing client-side leaves the wire exactly as it is today while the stored
// form stops being an unsalted digest that a rainbow table resolves instantly.
//
// Legacy: early builds stored a bare 32-character MD5 hex digest. amuleapi has not shipped, so
// there is no installed base, but developer configs exist -- those lines still verify, and
// Verify() reports that the record wants rewriting so the caller can transparently upgrade it.

// Hashes an MD5 hex digest into a new PHC-style record with a fresh
// random salt. Returns an empty string if `md5_hex` is not 32 hex chars.
std::string HashMd5Hex(const std::string &md5_hex);

// Constant-time verification of `md5_hex` against a stored record, in either the PHC or the legacy

// file as an empty set rather than an error, which is the first-run state, but fails on an unknown

// to happen -- the child would simply find nothing and fall back to its configured password, with
