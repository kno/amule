// XOR-accumulator constant-time equality. Returns false immediately on length mismatch (length is
// not the secret); for equal-length inputs the timing is data-independent.
//
// **PRECONDITION on the `wxString` overload.** wxString is a UTF-16 or UTF-32 sequence depending on
// the build, and the comparator checks sequence length first, not byte length. Inputs that round-
// trip through different UTF-8 encodings and share an underlying string but differ in codepoint
// count short-circuit as unequal. Callers today compare fixed-shape inputs (32-char hex MD5,
// 43-char base64url HMAC) so the precondition holds. Length-variable callers MUST pad to a common
// bound first, or accept a length side-channel leak.
