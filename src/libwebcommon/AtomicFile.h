// the ones it is created with -- creating at 0600 rather than chmod-ing afterwards closes the
// window where another user could open it. fchmod is applied anyway, as belt and braces against an
// odd umask.

// Windows: best effort. There is no equivalent permission story -- see RestrictToOwner() in
// FileFunctions.cpp, a no-op on Windows for the same reason -- so callers holding a secret must not
// rely on this for confidentiality there.

// this lives below the logger, as the mulecommon file helpers do, so the caller decides what to
