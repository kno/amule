// Single include site for picojson. Include this wrapper rather than picojson.h directly.
//
// PICOJSON_USE_INT64 switches picojson::value's number storage from the default double to int64_t,
// so large integers (file sizes, ECIDs, ...) survive exactly. It changes the layout of
// picojson::value, so it is ABI-affecting: every translation unit that includes picojson.h must
// define it identically, or the TUs disagree on the type -- an ODR violation the compiler cannot
// catch. Defining it here, once, keeps the toggle from drifting between use sites. It is set at the
// use site rather than patched into picojson.h so the vendored header stays byte-identical to
// upstream (see docs/THIRDPARTY.md).
#define PICOJSON_USE_INT64

// USE_SYSTEM_PICOJSON (src/libwebcommon/CMakeLists.txt) sets AMULE_PICOJSON_HEADER to the absolute
// path of the selected header -- the bundled copy by default, or a system-installed one for distro
// packaging. The path is absolute so include-directory ordering cannot substitute the other copy.
// The <picojson.h> fallback is defensive only; the macro is always defined for the targets that
// link picojson_header.
