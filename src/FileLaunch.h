/**
 * Handing a file to the desktop: opening it, and showing it in the file manager. Shared by the
 * Downloads and Shared Files lists so the two cannot drift; both are compiled per-executable, and
 * nothing here branches on the build variant.
 *
 * Availability is decided by whether the path exists on *this* host rather than by which binary is
 * running. The monolithic app is the core, so its files are always local; amulegui drives a
 * separate daemon and holds that daemon's path (EC_TAG_KNOWNFILE_PATH), which resolves here only
 * when the two share a filesystem. Testing the path covers both, and also catches what the old
 * build-variant gate missed: a local file that has since been moved or deleted.
 *
 * It cannot distinguish a remote daemon whose path happens to exist locally as a *different* file.
 * That is accepted: the alternative refuses every legitimate shared-filesystem setup.
