/**
 * Run a shared-files reload behind a progress dialog.
 *
 * CSharedFileList::Reload() walks every configured share root on the calling thread, costing
 * roughly a stat per shared file. On a large or network-mounted tree that is seconds to minutes,
 * and the no-callback overload yields nothing at all -- so every GUI action triggering one used to
 * freeze the window with no repaint, no progress and no indication why. A yield callback keeps the
 * walk on this thread but pumps the event loop every 256 files, so the window repaints and stays
 * draggable.
 *
 * Shared by every GUI entry point that can trigger a walk -- the shared-files Reload button, the
 * preferences Apply, and the category add/rename/delete paths -- so they all behave the same and
 * the dialog exists once.
 *
 * **Pumping here is safe.** wxProgressDialog restricts its yield to UI events, so it does not
 * dispatch the queued socket events that carry EC requests (they reach the main loop via
 * CoreNotify_* and wxQueueEvent). A remote client therefore cannot be answered from the
 * transiently-empty share map FindSharedFiles builds through, which is the hazard that rules out
 * pumping the loop generally during a walk.
 *
 * **No cancel button, deliberately.** FindSharedFiles() clears m_Files_map before it starts
 * walking, so an aborted walk leaves a partially populated share list with nothing to roll back to.
 * PrefsUnifiedDlg's shared-directory commit can offer cancel only because it keeps the previous
 * directory list and re-walks against it; none of these callers has such prior state.
