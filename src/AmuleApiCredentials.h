 * amuleapi, amuled and monolithic aMule all write it. The format and the hashing belong to
 * webcommon/Credentials.h so the three cannot drift apart -- this header is only the glue between
 * that store and aMule's preferences.
 *

 * to another machine. amulegui asks the daemon to make the change over EC, and the daemon lands

 *  - guest disabled clears the guest credential, which is what turns guest access off;

 *  - guest enabled with an empty digest leaves the stored guest password alone, so an EC client can
 *    change the port without resending a password it can never read back.
 *
 * Each applied digest is cleared from the preferences afterwards, so the request is not replayed on
 * the next save.
 *
 * Returns false and fills `error` if the file could not be written. Preferences applied before the
 * failure stay applied -- each role is written separately, and a half-applied change is better left
 * visible than silently rolled back to a password the user thinks they replaced.
