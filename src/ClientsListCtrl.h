/**
 * Every peer we are currently talking to, once each.
 *
 * The per-file lists (CSourceListCtrl, CSharedFilePeersListCtrl) answer "who is
 * on this file". This answers "who am I talking to", which is a different
 * question: the same peer can be a source for one download and a requester for
 * another, and only a per-client view can say so. Hence the file *count*
 * column, which the per-file lists have no way to express.
 *
 * Rows hold values rather than clients. A CClientRef would be the obvious
 * alternative and is the wrong tool -- those are owning (Unlink() deletes at
 * the last release), so the list would keep every peer it ever saw alive and
 * would never be told to let go, because the signal it is waiting for comes
 * from the destructor its own reference is preventing. The one thing a row
 * keeps of the peer itself is its ECID, which is a name to look it up by on
 * demand rather than a claim that it still exists.
