/**
 * The model behind a browse tab: the same result list as a search, grouped under the directories
 * the peer reported.
 *
 * Extends rather than alters CSearchListModel, because a browse is the only place folders exist --
 * an ordinary Kad/eD2k search has no directory to group by, and nothing about its model should have
 * to know that folders are a possibility.
 *
 * The directory strings nest. A peer names each shared directory by walking up from it for as long
 * as the parent is also shared and joining that run (CSharedFileList::GetPublicSharedDirName), so
 * what arrives is a relative path -- "Shared/Movies/Action" -- rather than a flat label or an
 * absolute path. Splitting it back into segments reproduces the peer's own layout.
 *
 * Both separators are split on. The sender uses its own platform's wxFileName::GetPathSeparator(),
 * so a Windows peer sends backslashes and a POSIX peer forward slashes, and nothing in the packet
 * says which. A directory whose name genuinely contains the other platform's separator would split
 * into segments that were never real folders; that is the trade eMule makes here too, and it costs
 * a cosmetic mis-grouping rather than a wrong file.
 *
 * Peers that answer the older whole-list request send no directory at all (ClientTCPSocket,
 * OP_ASKSHAREDFILESANSWER passes an empty string). Those results have no folder to sit under and
 * stay at the top level, so browsing such a peer looks exactly like it did before folders existed.
 *
 * The incremental add path does not know about folders, and does not need to.
 * CSearchListModel::FlushPending() announces every parentless result under the invisible root,
 * which is not where this model puts them -- but incremental notifications are only enabled on
 * __WXOSX__, and wxCocoaDataViewControl::Add() discards the items it is given and calls
 * [NSOutlineView reloadData], which re-reads the tree through GetChildren(). GTK and MSW take the
 * Cleared() branch, which re-reads it too. Either way the grouping below is what the control ends
 * up drawing.

	 * Most nodes the tree is ever deep, counted end to end and not per directory string.
	 *
	 * The strings are whatever the peer put in the packets, each up to 64 KB
	 * (CFileDataIO::ReadString defaults to a uint16 length) and checked by nothing between the
	 * socket and here. Two separate costs follow, and they need two separate bounds.
	 *
	 * Per string, every segment is a recursion level in EnsureFolder() and a node keyed by its
	 * own prefix, so one directory named with 65,535 separators is that many frames and the sum
	 * of all those prefixes in live wxStrings. The depth argument to EnsureFolder() stops it.
	 *
	 * Across strings, chains compose: EnsureFolder() hands back an existing node with the
	 * parents it already has, so a path bottoming out on one an earlier string created inherits
	 * everything above it. Counting calls cannot see that -- a peer sending directories
	 * shortest-first adds a capped run per packet and nests without limit. So a node also
	 * carries its own depth (CBrowseFolderNode::GetDepth) and refuses to be attached past this,
	 * which is the bound HasContent() and CSearchListCtrl::SetSubtreeExpanded() need: both
	 * recurse over the tree rather than over any one string.
	 *
	 * A peer names a directory by joining the run of shared directories it belongs to
	 * (CSharedFileList::GetPublicSharedDirName), so a real one is a handful of segments deep
	 * and nothing legitimate comes near this. Where either bound bites, the remainder is left
	 * as one folder name rather than split further.
	 *
	 * What this bounds is the recursion and the depth of the tree, which is the crash. It is
	 * not a bound on memory: a capped string still leaves about MAX_FOLDER_DEPTH nodes, each
	 * keyed by its own prefix of it, so a 64 KB directory name costs a few MB of live keys
	 * rather than the GBs it would unbounded -- and that still scales with how many such
	 * strings the peer sends.
