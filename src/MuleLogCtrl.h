// Replaces the wxTE_RICH2 log panes (aMule Log, aMuleGUI Log, server info). RichEdit holds the
// whole document and reflows O(n) on scroll, so the tens of thousands of lines a remote-GUI first
// sync can dump made scrolling crawl and left the view mispainted, only the tail visible until a
// manual scroll (issues #445, #547). Scintilla renders only the visible lines, so scroll and full-
// history retention stay O(visible) at any size, and unlike a virtual list it keeps character-level
// selection and find.
