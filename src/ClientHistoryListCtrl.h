 * monolithic build fills these from CClientCreditsList and amulegui from an
 * EC reply, and a value type is the only thing both can produce. It also means
 * the list holds nothing that can be freed underneath it -- the history is a
 * snapshot of something that only changes when a peer connects or leaves.
 *
 * Every field except the hash and the totals is optional. A record written
 * before aMule kept per-peer metadata has no name, address or software, and a
 * daemon too old to send it leaves them empty too; the list renders the gaps
 * as blanks rather than pretending to know.
