#ifndef COUNTRYDISPLAY_H

//
// Which country code a list should display for one entry -- the rule shared by the peer list and
// the server list, so the two cannot drift apart.
//
// The body below is deliberately NOT in a .cpp: the answer depends on ENABLE_IP2COUNTRY /
// CLIENT_GUI, which are per-target compile definitions. CountryFlags.cpp -- the obvious neighbour
// -- lives in muleappgui, one static library built once and linked into both binaries, so it sees
// neither define and could only ever produce the amulegui answer. Compiling per includer is what
// makes the monolithic build take the local-resolver path at all.
//
// The corollary: include this only from sources built once per variant (the list controls are),
// never from a shared library like muleappgui, or one binary links two different definitions.
//

#include "amule.h" // Needed for theApp and GEOIP_GUI
#if defined(GEOIP_GUI) && !defined(CLIENT_GUI)
#include "IP2Country.h" // Needed for CIP2Country (monolithic local lookup)

/**
 * The country code to display for one list entry.
 *
 * The core emits its country tag whenever its resolver is enabled -- even as an empty string for an
 * address that resolved to nothing -- so a tag that arrived over EC is authoritative: @a fromCore
 * true means the core knows, and an empty @a coreCode then means "unknown", not "GeoIP is off".
 * Only a build with no such feed (monolithic aMule) falls back to its own resolver, which carries
 * its enabled state itself.
 *
 * Deliberately no thePrefs::IsGeoIPEnabled() on top: on amulegui that pref only mirrors the core's,
 * refreshed at prefs-sync time, so consulting it could never do more than disagree with the tag we
 * were handed.
 *
 * @param fromCore Whether the core sent a country tag for this entry.
 * @param coreCode The code it sent (meaningful only when @a fromCore).
 * @param ip       Numeric address, for the monolithic local lookup. Numeric rather than dotted so
 *                 it hits the resolver's cache -- the string overload is uncached and goes straight
 *                 to the database, which on a paint path means a lookup per row per repaint.
 * @param code     Receives the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code; may come back empty for an address that
 *                 did not resolve.
 * @return false when no country is known at all -- render neither icon nor text.
