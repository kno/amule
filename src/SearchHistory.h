// Pure list logic behind the Search tab's Name-field query history (amule-org/amule#641, #643) --
// kept free of CSearchDlg/wxComboBox so it is unit-testable without a wx GUI event loop. This is
// query history: the strings the user typed, not the results a search returned (that is the
// separate, not-yet-implemented result persistence tracked in #641).

// How many past queries the Search tab keeps. Started at eMule's CCustomAutoComplete default of 30
// (amule-org/amule#643 review) and raised on request (#755): a search history is only useful as far
// back as it reaches, and clearing it has been a deliberate, confirmed action since #754. It lives
// here rather than in SearchDlg.cpp so the tests can assert the value the GUI actually passes
// instead of mirroring a copy of it.

// entries dropping off the tail first. An empty `term` returns `existing` unchanged.
