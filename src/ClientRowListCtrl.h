/**
 * A list whose rows describe peers, with the behaviour that implies.
 *
 * The Clients page shows two such lists -- who we are talking to now, and
 * everyone we have ever talked to -- and they want the same things: the Name
 * cell drawn with its badge icons, the details dialog on double-click or Enter,
 * and the peer context menu on right-click. What differs is only how a row
 * names its peer: the active list keeps an ECID, the history keeps a user hash,
 * because an ECID means nothing once the daemon that issued it has restarted.
 *
 * So that difference is all a subclass supplies. Everything built on top of it
 * lives here once, which is also why the actions are reached through
 * ClientContextActions rather than reimplemented: the per-file client lists in
 * Downloads and Shared files run the same code from CGenericClientListCtrl.
 *
 * Rows hold values, never clients. A CClientRef would be owning, so a list
 * holding one would keep every peer it ever showed alive; the peer is resolved
 * only when something is actually done to it, and a row whose peer has since
 * gone still names it well enough to act on from the record alone.
