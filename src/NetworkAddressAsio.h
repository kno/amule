// Boost.Asio's socket headers redeclare constexpr static members out of line
// and give several classes a user-provided destructor alongside an implicit
// copy constructor. Both are deprecated in C++17 and both are diagnosed by
// Clang, so with the -Werror=deprecated gate in src/CMakeLists.txt they fail
// the build -- in third-party code this tree does not own. Same pragma-wrap
// convention as CryptoPP_Inc.h and the wx wraps from #341, and the same
// reason: the headers are discovered without -isystem, so the gate reaches
// them. Kept to exactly these two diagnostics rather than a blanket
// -Wno-deprecated, so a genuine deprecation in aMule's own code still fails.

/**
 * The one bridge between CNetworkAddress and Boost.Asio.
 *
 * CNetworkAddress deliberately stores its own sixteen octets rather than an
 * asio address, so that the 155 translation units that merely pass an address
 * around stop compiling asio's ~1200-header closure and stop needing @c ws2_32
 * at link time (see the class comment in NetworkAddress.h). The socket backend
 * still has to hand a real @c asio::ip::address to a real socket, so the
 * conversion lives here -- in a header that says asio in its name, and that
 * only the TUs actually opening sockets include.
 *
 * Include this from a TU that talks to asio. Do @b not include it from a public
 * header: doing so re-establishes exactly the coupling this file exists to
 * confine, and nothing will warn you about it until macOS and mingw-w64 CI do.

 *      default-constructed address is @c 0.0.0.0, which is exactly the
 *      conflation CNetworkAddress exists to prevent, so an absent address must
 *      be handled by the caller rather than silently becoming the wildcard.
