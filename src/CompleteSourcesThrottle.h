/**
 * Whether an otherwise-throttled complete-sources recompute must run anyway.
 *
 * CKnownFile::UpdatePartsInfo() only recomputes every 60 s. One transition cannot wait that out:
 * the upload list going empty. Every caller is driven by a peer event and there is no periodic
 * sweep, so if the last requesting peer leaves inside the window, the throttled call is the last
 * one that file will ever get and the counts keep their values for the life of the process.
 *
 * Non-zero is asked of all three exported fields, not just the scalar. They do not move together:
 * Hi is a percentile of the peers' self-reported counts and is only ever floored at the scalar,
 * never tied to it, so a mixed population -- the norm, since a peer without extended requests v2
 * contributes 0 -- settles at scalar 0 with Hi non-zero. Guarding on the scalar alone let that Hi
 * through, and the desktop column and Web UI detail panel both render "< Hi" whenever Lo is 0, so
 * the file kept claiming sources it no longer had (issue #1065). Lo cannot diverge from the scalar,
 * but it is included so the guard stays honest if the estimation is ever changed.
 *
 * Still false once all three have settled at 0, which is what stops an idle shared file re-entering
 * the recompute on every later call.
 *
 * Free function in a header of its own so it can be unit-tested: CKnownFile itself reaches theApp
 * and cannot be linked into a test.
