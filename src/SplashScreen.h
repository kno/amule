// Startup splash for the monolithic GUI.
//
// Exists because startup is slow and silent: the main window is created before the shared-file scan
// runs, but the scan holds the main thread, so nothing paints until it finishes. On a large share
// -- worse on network storage, where every file costs a round trip -- that is a long stretch with
// no sign the application is alive, and under Flatpak long enough for xdg-desktop-portal's
// background monitor to conclude the app has no window and kill it.
//
// Everything is drawn by hand rather than assembled from child controls: the background is a dark
// gradient, and native widgets on top of it would follow the desktop theme instead, giving a light-
// on-dark gauge on most systems.
