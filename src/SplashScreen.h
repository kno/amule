// Startup splash for the monolithic GUI.
//
// Exists because startup is slow and silent: the main window is created
// before the shared-file scan runs, but the scan holds the main thread, so
// nothing paints until it finishes. On a large share -- worse still on
// network storage, where every file costs a round trip instead of a page
// cache hit -- that is a long stretch with no sign the application is alive.
// Under Flatpak it is also long enough for xdg-desktop-portal's background
// monitor to conclude the app has no window and kill it.
//
// Everything is drawn by hand rather than assembled from child controls: the
// background is a dark gradient and native widgets on top of it would follow
// the desktop theme instead, giving a light-on-dark gauge on most systems.
