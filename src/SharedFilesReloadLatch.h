/**
 * The "a shared-files reload is owed" flag, on its own so the rules can be tested without standing
 * up a CSharedFileList (which needs theApp, the preferences and a filesystem to walk).
 *
 * Three rules, and the middle one is why this is not a plain bool:
 *
 *  - Requests coalesce. Ten callers asking before the next tick get one walk.
 *  - A request arriving *during* a walk belongs to the NEXT walk. The walk in flight is already
 * past the files that request was about, so it cannot satisfy it. BeginWalk() takes the outstanding
 * request with it, which leaves anything requested afterwards standing.
 *  - A walk that aborts satisfies nothing, so EndWalk() hands the request back rather than letting
 * a cancelled scan swallow it.
 *
 * Single-threaded by contract: every caller runs on the core event loop. A caller off that thread
 * is the thing to fix, not this.
