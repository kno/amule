/**
 * Which ECIDs the client was told about last cycle and is no longer being told about, i.e. the ones
 * needing an explicit `EC_TAG_FILE_REMOVED`.
 *
 * Both inputs must be sorted ascending and duplicate-free, which makes this a single linear pass
 * over two contiguous arrays instead of a lookup per file. `Get_EC_Response_GetUpdate` gets that
 * ordering for free: it walks the encoder map, which is kept sorted by ECID.
 *
 * Deliberately pure, and deliberately not taking a CECPacket. Getting this wrong fails silently in
 * both directions -- a missed removal leaves an entry in the client's list forever, a spurious one
 * deletes a file the user still has -- so it is worth being testable without an app, a daemon, or a
 * connected client.
 *
 * @param previous ECIDs sent in the previous response.
 * @param current  ECIDs being sent in this one.
 * @param removed  Receives the difference, ascending. Cleared first.
