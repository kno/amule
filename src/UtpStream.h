/**

 *
 * libutp hands bytes up in a callback and takes bytes down through a call, and neither happens when
 * the eD2k stack above wants it to. This holds the two queues in between and answers the would-
 * block questions CEMSocket asks, so the state machine can be tested without a library, a socket or
 * a peer.
 *
 * It calls nothing. Read-drained and window notifications are the transport's to send, from the
 * main thread; this only reports when they are due, because a class that both buffers bytes and re-
 * enters libutp is the one that deadlocks when libutp calls back into it.
