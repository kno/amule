// amuleapi's three on-disk config files, in the user's amule config dir, independent of
// remote.conf:
//
//   amuleapi.conf         INI -- HTTP bind + port + EC connection params + auth tunables
//   amuleapi-jwt-secret   raw hex (64 chars + \n) -- HMAC-SHA-256 key
//   amuleapi-passwords    two-line text -- admin=<record> / guest=<record>
//
// The credential records are owned by webcommon/Credentials.h, not by this class: amuled and
// monolithic aMule write the same file when a password is changed from amulegui or the preferences
// dialog, so the format has exactly one implementation and the three cannot drift.
//
// `amuleapi-jwt-secret` is auto-generated with 32 random bytes on first run. `amuleapi-passwords`
// may be empty, in which case the daemon refuses /auth/login until at least one role is set via
// `amuleapi --set-admin-pass=...`, from amulegui, or over REST. `amuleapi.conf` is created from
// defaults if missing.
//
// POSIX: both secret files must be 0600; looser bits make the daemon refuse to start with an
// actionable error. Windows has no equivalent enforcement (QUICKSTART covers ACL mitigation).
