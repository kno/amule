/**
 * The eD2k server capability bitmasks, decoded to stable JSON keys.
 *
 * A server announces what it supports as two bitmasks; the API decodes them server-side so a
 * consumer never has to carry a copy of the aMule protocol headers, the same rule /clients already
 * follows for its numeric enums (see ClientTagNames.h).
 *
 * Header-only, and deliberately built around a string-returning helper rather than a per-writer
 * emit loop: the REST object (Api.cpp, via CJsonWriter) and the SSE payload (EventDiff.cpp, via
 * ostringstream) use different writers but are documented as carrying the identical object, so they
 * call the same function and emit the same bytes. Only the two tables below decide what a flags
 * object contains; adding a bit is a one-line change both paths pick up.
 *
 * EventDiff.cpp is compiled into EventDiffTest, which is stdlib-only by design, so nothing here may
 * reach for wxWidgets or EC.
 *
 * These are protocol tokens, not display text: untranslated and stable. The desktop's TCP/UDP Flags
 * columns render the same bits as single letters (ServerListCtrl.cpp).

 * branches on key existence. `bitmask` rides along for the diagnostic case and for any bit a future
 * server announces that this build does not name yet -- decoding to booleans alone would silently
 * drop it.
 *
 * All keys are ASCII literals from the tables, so no JSON escaping is needed.
