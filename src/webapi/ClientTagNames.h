 * peers behind /clients, and the on-demand handler for /known_clients, whose records carry the same
 * software, origin and obfuscation codes. Two copies would be free to drift, and the tokens are
 * part of the API surface -- a consumer switching on "kad" must get the same answer whichever
 * endpoint produced it.
 *
 * Deliberately not the GUI's rendering: these are protocol tokens, not display text, so they stay
 * untranslated and stable.
