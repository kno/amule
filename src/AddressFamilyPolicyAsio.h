/**
 * Socket-specific address-family policy and Boost.Asio values.
 *
 * Split from AddressFamilyPolicy.h so that a translation unit which only needs to know @b whether a
 * family is permitted does not compile asio's socket headers to find out. Unlike asio's
 * ip/address.hpp, ip/tcp.hpp reaches the boost/asio/execution headers, which do not survive this
 * tree's -Werror=deprecated gate unmodified -- see the measurement above the include.
 *
 * Include this only from a TU that opens a socket or resolves a name; including it from a public
 * header puts asio back into the closure of most of src/, which is what the split undoes.

 * The protocol and address for one connection attempt, decided together.
 *
 * Deciding the protocol and the address separately does not work for an IPv4-mapped target. The
 * family test calls it IPv4, because a mapped address is reachable over IPv4, while
 * NetworkAddressAsio::ToAsioAddress() preserves the family and hands back an @c address_v6, and
 * connecting the two gives EAFNOSUPPORT on every mapped peer. Narrowing the address here is what
 * makes the pair agree, and returning them together is what stops them drifting apart again.
 *
 * This supersedes a protocol-only accessor that took a target and returned just the @c tcp. It
 * was removed rather than left beside this one: a caller reaching for it would pair it with
 * ToAsioAddress() and land back on that same mismatch, and the protocol for a listening socket
 * comes from the endpoint built on AnyAddress() rather than from a target.
 *
 * Returning one optional also removes the other half of that footgun. With two calls a caller
 * writes `sock.open(*ProtocolFor(t))` after a separate Permits() check and dereferences an empty
 * optional if anything moved in between; here there is one decision and one thing to test.
 *
 * There is no fallback: a v4 socket opened for a v6 target is how a truncated address turns into
 * a connection to the wrong host, so a family the configuration refuses yields no pair at all.
 *
 * Not @c noexcept, unlike the predicates beside it: NetworkAddressAsio::ToAsioAddress() is an
 * out-of-line function that makes no such promise, and inheriting one here would turn a future
 * throw into a terminate rather than something a caller can handle.
 *
 * @return The pair, or no value when @a target is absent, unspecified, or of a family the
 *         configuration does not permit.
