/**
 * Dedicated worker sampling the free space on the temp and incoming directories, published through
 * CStatistics for the Downloads and Shared Files panels.
 *
 * Why its own thread: statvfs() / GetDiskFreeSpaceEx() blocks on the directory it is asked about.
 * On a local disk that is microseconds, but either directory is commonly a network mount, where a
 * cold autofs mount takes tens to hundreds of milliseconds and an unreachable server blocks for the
 * mount's timeout, unbounded on a hard mount. The two callers are the GUI timer on the main thread
 * and the EC stats reply on the core thread, so an inline probe puts that stall in front of the
 * whole application.
 *
 * Nothing else in the core reaches those filesystems from the main loop: downloads write through
 * CPartFileWriteThread and uploads read through CUploadDiskIOThread. This probe would have been the
 * one exception.
 *
 * Isolated rather than queued onto CThreadScheduler for the same reason CMediaProbeThread is: that
 * scheduler runs one task at a time and owns completion, allocation and hashing, so a probe blocked
 * on a hung mount would not delay that queue but stop it -- and would couple unrelated filesystems,
 * a hung incoming mount blocking the hashing of part files on a healthy local disk. Here a hung
 * mount can only delay the next sample: the figure goes stale, the label empties, and nothing else
 * notices.
