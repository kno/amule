class wxSingleInstanceChecker;

// Cross-instance detector for aMule.
//
// Replaces wxSingleInstanceChecker on POSIX because wx's stale-lock recovery falls back to
// kill(pid, 0) for liveness, which false-negatives across Linux PID namespaces (Flatpak sandboxes,
// container runtimes): every sandbox has its own PID 1..N, so the PID written by the first instance
// always maps to a live process in the second's namespace, and IsAnotherRunning() returns false
// because m_pidLocker == getpid() on both sides. Result: two aMule processes stomping on the same
// config and downloads directory.
//
// This class uses fcntl(F_SETLK) directly: the kernel - not a PID compare - owns the truth about
// who holds the lock, and it is namespace-independent. On process death (clean exit, crash,
// SIGKILL) the kernel releases the lock, so a lock file left over from a crashed run self-heals on
// the next start.
//
// On Windows the wxSingleInstanceChecker path is retained: it uses a named mutex, which is already
// namespace-aware.

	// CamuleAppCommon::RefreshSingleInstanceChecker() relies on that after the daemon fork().
	//
	// `selfKind` is recorded in the lock file beside the pid: "amule", "amuled" or "amulegui".
	// amuled shares muleLock with the monolithic GUI, so a second launch that finds the lock
	// held has to know whether the holder has a window to raise. A daemon has none, and a raise
	// request posted to one is the same silence as no message at all.
