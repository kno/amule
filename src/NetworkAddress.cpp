// The only translation unit in the ed2k core that compiles Boost.Asio for the
// sake of an address.
//
// CNetworkAddress stores its own octets so that the 155 TUs which merely pass
// an address around no longer pull asio's include closure (and, on Windows, no
// longer need ws2_32 to link) -- the full argument is in NetworkAddress.h. But
// two of its operations are text handling, and text handling is where a
// hand-rolled implementation goes wrong quietly: RFC 4291 zero compression has
// a canonical form with real rules (longest run, leftmost on a tie, never a
// single group), IPv4-mapped addresses print with a dotted-quad tail, and a
// literal may carry a %scope suffix. Restating that here would be a parser and
// a formatter to maintain, so both stay asio's job and pay for themselves in
// this one file.
