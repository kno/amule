/**
 * Per-IP sliding-window failure rate limiter.
 *
 * Tracks failed authentication attempts and locks the offending address out for `lockout_seconds`
 * once `threshold` failures land inside `window_seconds`. A success resets that address's bucket.
 *
 * Lives in mulecommon because both authenticated front doors need it: the amuleapi HTTP login and
 * the External Connection password exchange. Nothing here touches wx or any protocol, so it stays
 * linkable from the daemon, which does not link the webapi library.
 *
 * Storage: one bucket per address. Real deployments serve a small population (a LAN operator, a
 * handful of clients), so the map stays small even under bot-scan load. No active GC; cold buckets
 * are overwritten when the offender returns, and process lifetime bounds the worst case.
