/**
 * wxDataViewModel backing a CSearchListCtrl. Presents the CSearchFile
 * parent/children forest for one search-id as a native tree.
 *
 * Two things that used to be hand-rolled in CSearchListCtrl::OnDrawItem /
 * ShowChildren are deliberately NOT reimplemented here:
 *  - Expand/collapse state is owned by wxDataViewCtrl itself (per-row, via
 *    Expand()/Collapse()/IsExpanded()), so GetChildren() always reports the
 *    full child set -- CSearchFile::ShowChildren()/SetShowChildren(), which
 *    the old hand-drawn tree used to fake this, is not consulted.
 *  - Tree connector lines and the expander glyph are drawn natively by the
 *    control from IsContainer()/GetChildren(), replacing
 *    CSearchListCtrl::OnDrawItem's manual DrawLine/DrawCircle code.
 *
 * Regex/known-file filtering (CSearchListCtrl::SetFilter) is a different
 * concept from expand/collapse -- a filtered-out result must not appear at
 * all, so it is excluded at the IsContainer()/GetChildren() level.
 *
 * The model does not own or cache the result set: GetChildren() queries
 * CSearchList::GetSearchResults() (via the owning CSearchListCtrl) live, so
 * there is a single source of truth and no separate bookkeeping to keep in
 * sync. AddFile()/RemoveFile()/UpdateFile() only need to notify the control
 * that something changed -- they are not the place new data is stored.
