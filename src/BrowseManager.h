 * invariant broken somewhere different -- a successful browse never marked
 * finished, a peer we declined to contact, a terminal browse re-examined on
 * every tick forever. One owner is the point: the lifecycle is decided by
 * browse::Tick and stored here, and every other subsystem reads it rather than
 * keeping a copy that has to be made to agree.
 *
 * Core-only. Everything that touches browse state -- CUpDownClient,
 * CClientTCPSocket, CSearchList, the EC handlers, and the monolithic search
 * dialog's #ifndef CLIENT_GUI paths -- is core; amulegui learns a browse's
