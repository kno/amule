/**
 * Draws a wxDataViewIconText cell, but only reserves room for the icon on the rows that actually
 * have one.
 *
 * wx's own icon+text renderer reserves the icon slot unconditionally, so in a column where the icon
 * is the exception rather than the rule -- a rating smiley on the handful of files that carry one
 * -- every other row's text is indented past an empty gap. On the native macOS cell the reserved
 * width is not even adjustable: wxImageTextCell hardcodes a 5px leading shift, a 5px icon-to-text
 * gap and a 16x16 icon as private ivars, none of them reachable from C++.
 *
 * Text is drawn through wxDataViewCustomRenderer::RenderText(), so ellipsizing, the selected-row
 * foreground colour and RTL layout stay exactly as the stock renderers do them; only the icon
 * placement is ours.
